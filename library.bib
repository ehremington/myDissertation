abstract = {The orientation texture of pulsed laser deposited hydroxyapatite coatings was studied by X-ray diffraction techniques. Increasing the laser energy density of the KrF excimer laser used in the deposition process from 5 to 7 J/cm(2) increases the tendency for the c-axes of the hydroxyapatite grains to be aligned perpendicular to the substrate. This preferred orientation is most pronounced when the incidence direction of the plume is normal to the substrate. Orientation texture of the hydroxyapatite grains in the coatings is associated with the highly directional and energetic nature of the ablation plume. Anisotropic stresses, transport of hydroxyl groups and dehydroxylation effects during deposition all seem to play important roles in the texture development.},

abstract = {The great potential of microelectrode measurements in several fields of solid state ionics is discussed and exemplified: (i) Microelectrodes are perfectly suited to investigate inhomogeneous bulk conductivities in ionic solids. This is demonstrated for a SrTiO3 single crystals with a non-stoichiometry profile. (ii) Microelectrode experiments are helpful in determining the distribution of grain boundary properties in ceramics with highly resistive grain boundaries. Data obtained on a SrTiO3 polycrystal are shown as an example. (iii) Experiments with microelectrodes allow the detection and quantification of highly conductive grain boundaries; the applicability of this measurement mode is demonstrated for AgCl. (iv) Microelectrodes can serve as model electrodes with well-defined three phase boundaries and interfaces. Investigations on Sr-doped LaMnO3 microelectrodes, for example, yielded an improved understanding of electrochemical processes in solid oxide fuel cells. (v) Microelectrodes are very sensitive to highly conductive surface layers and therefore suited to investigate ionic materials with enhanced surface conductivity (e.g. AgCl). (vi) Several other applications of microelectrodes in solid state ionics are briefly touched upon.},

abstract = {La1−xSrxPO4 samples of nominal composition x=0.025 and x=0.050 were prepared by powder combustion synthesis, cold-pressing, and sintering at 1300 °C. Samples with Pt paste electrodes were characterized by conductivity measurements, impedance spectroscopy, and transport number measurements. The samples are predominantly protonic conductors below 700 °C in wet oxygen, as proven for the first time with the EMF/water vapour concentration cell method. The modelling of the conductivity data over a large temperature range suggests that the entropy and enthalpy changes of the incorporation of water vapour to hydrolyse the P2O74− group into two HPO42− groups are −90 J/mol K and −83 kJ/mol, respectively. Impedance spectroscopy showed that grain boundary resistance is dominant only below 400 °C and thus not a severe problem for applications. The synthesis procedure is convenient and upscaleable, but at this stage, the proton conductivity appears to be somewhat lower than reported elsewhere, assigned in part to insufficient dopant homogenisation.},

abstract = {Proton conductive properties of Gd-doped BaCeO3ceramics were investigated by electrochemical methods (hydrogen permeation test and hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell test) in the temperature range of 600°C to 1000°C. As a result of electrochemical hydrogen- permeation tests, it was verified that the proton was the only conductive species in BaCe1-xGdixO3-$\alpha$in the absence of oxygen at 600°C-1000°C. Next the relationship between conductivity and Gd-substitution value of x BaCe1-xGdxO3-$\alpha$(0.5 <x<3.0) was determined in various atmospheres. The highest conductivity was observed for 0.20<x<0.25. A fuel cell using BaCe0.8Gd0.2O3-$\alpha$ceramics with a thickness of 0.5 mm as a solid electrolyte was constructed. The short-circuit currents of this cell were 1.2AA cm-2at 1000°C, and 0.8 A cm-2at 800°C, which were the best performances in the fuel cell using perovskite-type electrolyte instead of YSZ. The transference numbers of mobile ions (protons and oxide ions) were determined from the evolution rate of water vapor at each electrode when the fuel cells were discharged. Regarding the temperature dependence on the transport numbers of proton and oxide ions, it was found that protonic conduction was fully dominant at 600°C. On the other hand, oxide ions were the main charge carriers at 1000°C and mixed conduction was observed in the temperature range of 600-1000°C. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Gadolinium-doped barium cerate perovskites of formula BaCe1-xGdxO3-x2 have been prepared and studied by X-ray powder diffraction, impedance spectroscopy, concentration cell and Faradaic oxygen transport cell techniques. The highest conductivity was observed for x=0.15, the maximum doping level for which single phase products were obtained. At temperatures of 500°C and below, the compounds exhibited mainly ionic conductivity with activation energies of 0.45 to 0.55 eV. The ionic transport number of BaCe1-xGdxO3-x2 (x=0.10) was studied by measurement of the total conductivity versus PO2 and the EMF of oxygen and hydrogen concentration cells. At high temperature and at high oxygen partial pressure this compound is a mixed ionic and p-type electronic conductor while at low oxygen partial pressure it is a pure ionic conductor. The Faradaic transport of oxygen was demonstrated, indicating that ionic conduction occurs predominantly by migration of oxide ions. The ionic component of the conductivity was determined as 11 mS cm-1 at 600°C and 16 mS cm-1 at 800°C. The value at 600°C is the highest measured for any perovskite oxide, including BaCeO3:Y and BaCeO3:Nd, and is about 60% of that reported for ceria-gadolinia solid electrolytes. However, unlike tha latter, barium cerate-based solid electrolytes are stable to reduction by hydrogen at high temperature and, thus, are good candidates for solid oxide fuel cell applications.},

Both the films and ceramics present the BaZrO3 perovskite structure. Structural, morphological, and electrical observations indicate a complex effect of ZnO addition in BZY ceramics. ZnO strongly affects the microstructure and electrical properties of the samples, whereas no trace of ZnO can be detected. All the observations indicate that Zn2+ is at least partially substituted to Zr4+ in the perovskite during the sintering process and that the presence of ZnO strongly affects the sintering behavior. The optimal conductivity/density ratio is obtained for 1 wt % ZnO. This sample was taken as a reference to determine the properties of the films. For the coating, the scanning electron microscope observations revealed that the as-deposited coatings are dense. The films are ?100 times more resistive than the pellets. This difference is due to a blocking effect related to the collecting system particularly strong in hydrogen.},

abstract = {Impedance spectroscopy is an important tool to investigate the electrical properties of grain boundaries. For the analysis of the impedance spectra cubic grains, laterally homogeneous grain boundaries and identical properties of all grain boundaries are usually assumed (brick layer model). However, in real ceramics these assumptions are generally violated. Using the finite element method we calculated the impedance of several polycrystals exhibiting highly resistive grain boundaries with microstructures and grain boundary properties deviating from the simple brick layer model. Detours around highly resistive regions (e.g. due to high grain boundary density or enhanced grain boundary resistivity) can play an important role and lead to grain-boundary semicircles depending on bulk properties and even to additional semicircles. Conditions are discussed within which the brick layer model allows for a reasonable evaluation of the spectra.},

abstract = {This paper is focused on the comparative analysis of data on electronic and ionic conduction in gadolinia-doped ceria (CGO) ceramics as well as on the electrochemical properties of various oxide electrodes in contact with ceria-based solid electrolytes. Properties of electrode materials, having thermal expansion compatible with that of doped ceria, are briefly reviewed. At temperatures below 1000 K, Ce0.90Gd0.10O2-delta (CGO10) was found to possess a better stability at reduced oxygen pressures than Ce0.80Gd0.20O2-delta (CGO20). Incorporation of small amounts of praseodymium oxide into Ce0.80Gd0.20O2-delta leads to a slight improvement of the stability of CGO20 at intermediate temperatures, but the difference between electrolytic domain boundaries of the Pr-doped material and CGO10 is insignificant. Since interaction of ceria-based ceramis with electrode materials, such as lanthanum-strontium manganites, may result in the formation of low-conductive layers at the electrode/electrolyte interface, optimization of electrode fabrication conditions is needed. A good electrochemical activity in contact with CGO20 electrolyte was pointed out for electrodes of perovskite-type La0.8Sr0.2Fe0.8Co0.2O3-delta and LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3-delta, and LaCoO3-delta/La2Zr2O7 composites; surface modification of the electrode layers with praseodymium oxide results in considerable decrease of cathodic overpotentials. Using highly-dispersed ceria for the activation of SOFC anodes significantly improves the fuel cell performance. (C) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {To address the wide range of reported conductivities in literature and investigate the viability of yttrium-doped barium zirconate (BaZr1-xYxO3) as a membrane in electrochemical devices, the factors governing the protonic transport properties have been explored, with the aim of attaining reproducible proton conductivity in well-densified samples. It was found that a small initial particle size and high temperature sintering in the presence of excess barium were essential. By this procedure, BaZr0.8Y0.2O3 with 93–99\% of theoretical density and high total (bulk plus grain boundary) conductivity could be reliably prepared. Samples sintered in the absence of excess barium displayed yttria precipitates and a bulk conductivity that was reduced by more than two orders of magnitude. Hydrogen transport across grain boundaries has been explored and the specific conductivity found to be two orders of magnitude lower than the bulk. Microstructural optimization of the total grain boundary conductivity included both decreasing total grain boundary density as well as improving intrinsic grain boundary properties. To investigate the influence of defect chemistry on stability, proton solubility, and proton mobility; samples with yttrium dopant concentration of 30 and 40 mol % were prepared in addition to the 20 Y mol %. Lattice parameters obtained suggests the solubility of yttrium in barium zirconate to be at least 40 mol %. Thermogravimetric analysis of the barium zirconate system showed excellent chemical stability under CO2 and protonic defects to be approaching theoretical hydrogen concentration for 20, 30, and 40 Y mol %. Significant hydroxyl-dopant associations were observed, especially at lower temperatures, which trap protons and impede transport. To simplify processing procedures, the influence of transitional metal oxides additives (especially zinc oxide) on the densification and electrical properties of doped barium zirconate have been examined. With the use of zinc oxide as a sintering aid, BaZr0.85Y0.15O3 was readily sintered to above 93% of theoretical density at 1300 °C. SEM investigations showed Zn accumulation in the intergranular regions. Electromotive force measurements of BaZr0.8Y0.2O3 showed the ionic transference number under fuel cell conditions to be at least 0.92 at 600 °C. Fuel cells based on BYZ20 were prepared and characterized.},

Emphasis is placed on obtaining an understanding of the real system and adequate transfer of the physical processes into the form of the equivalent circuit for the extraction of reliable conductivity data. In order to verify that the method can determine anisotropic conductivity, novel fluorous block copolymers with various anisotropic phase segregated morphologies were evaluated. All polymer electrolyte membranes examined exhibited a Nyquist plot response in the form of a straight line with an angle of approximately 70°–80° to the Z′-axis. Interfacial capacitance, membrane bulk resistance and membrane bulk capacitance were considered as contributing parameters to the impedance of the system; high frequency inductance and contact resistance were instrumentally minimized. A marginally anisotropic conductivity ($\sigma$=/$\sigma$⊥=1.0–1.4) was found in all Nafion{\textregistered} samples. Fluorous block copolymers with disordered morphology exhibited higher conductivity in the through-plane direction by a factor of 1.4. For the polymers with perforated lamellae and lamellae morphologies, in-plane conductivities were larger by factors of 2.4 and 5.5, respectively.},

The acceleration of shrinkage behavior, improved sinterability and larger grain size were achieved by the partial substitution of Zr with Ni in the BZY perovskite.  Phase pure Ni-doped BZY powders of nominal compns. BaZr0.8-xY0.2NixO3-$\delta$ were synthesized up to x = 0.04 using a wet chem. combustion synthesis route.  BaZr0.76Y0.2Ni0.04O3-$\delta$ (BZYNi04) exhibited adequate total cond. and the open circuit voltage (OCV) values measured on the BZYNi04 pellet suggested lack of significant electronic contribution.  The improved sinterability of BZYNi04 assisted the ease in film fabrication and this coupled with the application of an anode functional layer and a suitable cathode, PrBaCo2O5+$\delta$ (PBCO), resulted in a superior fuel cell power performance.

The films deposited with a low deposition rate exhibited highly oriented microstructures with little grain boundaries. The electrical conductivities of these films were higher than those of the films, deposited with high deposition rates, which showed little-oriented polycrystalline microstructure. While the films deposited on the MgO substrates had a stoichiometric composition, those deposited on the sapphire substrates had a high barium deficiency, which was possibly due to the differences in the crystal structure and large lattice mismatch between the sapphire substrate and the BZY film. The electrical conductivity of the highly oriented BZY film, grown on MgO substrate with a low deposition rate, showed little barium deficiency and the highest conductivity value that is higher than the typical conductivity of sintered pellets.},

Two urban districts in the City of Macau were chosen as sample test cases based on two approaches of carbon emissions analysis, land use-based and building simulation methods. The result shows that the building simulation method is 20% more accurate than the land use based-method in comparison to the actual measurement by including the factor of building shape in the simulations. The analytical results of energy performance, carbon emissions and solar availability were then used to derive urban design guidelines to move the city development toward a low carbon future.},

High quality MWNT having smooth walls, few defects, and low amounts of by-products such as amorphous carbon were obtained, even from catalysts with large Ni concentrations (> 50 wt.%). By adjusting the experimental parameters, such as flux of the carbon precursor (ethylene) and Ni concentration, both the MWNT morphology and the process yield could be controlled.

For the perovskite phase, the proton diffusivity is obtained directly from water-concentration-dependent conductivities and the oxygen diffusion coefficient from18O-tracer experiments. The results are analyzed consistently in terms of the concentrations and diffusivities of elementary defects. In return, the ionic transference numbers and the chemical diffusion coefficient of water are determined and compared with the experimentally observed kinetics of water uptake. The data suggest structure diffusion as the operating proton conduction mechanism with the proton transfer mode in the configuration OH-/O2-as the rate-limiting step. It is proposed that the mechanism is heavily assisted by extended vibrations of OH-/ O2-about their equilibrium position. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

They fall into two groups: the simple or ABO3 types and the complex (or mixed) types of formula A2B′B″O6 and A3B′B2″O9. Some microstructural features observed by TEM and electron diffraction are pointed out. A simple “first-order” model is then given to serve as a basis for consideration of various fundamental aspects of these protonic conductors. Three fundamental aspects are considered: the nature of proton incorporation by exposure to water vapor at high temperatures, the environment in which protons are located in the lattice, and the nature of proton migration. Proton incorporation is studied by water uptake experiments and the proton environment by spectroscopic techniques. Proton migration is studied by conductivity and isotope-effect experiments, which show that migration occurs by simple hopping of protons from one O2− ion to the next. However, the classical absolute rate theory (ART) requires modification because of the low efficiency of energy transfer between an excited proton and the cage of heavy ions that surrounds it.},

The activation enthalpy for oxygen tracer diffusion was found to be 0.9 eV in the temperature range 450–650 °C, and 0.8 eV in the temperature range 650–1100 °C. The activation enthalpy for the surface exchange reaction showed a marked transition from . The ionic conductivity of the samples was measured by ac impedance spectroscopy which gave an activation enthalpy of 1.1 eV. The Arrhenius plots of the ac impedance data showed some curvature due to vacancy trapping by (Y′ZrVo..). defect associates at lower temperatures, and it was found that the binding enthalpy of these associates (0.26 eV) contributed significantly to the overall activation enthalpy. An intercomparison between the oxygen diffusivities obtained from the two techniques shows a high degree of correlation across the temperature range examined, however, we identify two temperature regimes where the correlation differs slightly. At higher temperatures (T > 650 °c) the diffusivities are related by a Haven ratio of 0.48, whereas at lower temperatures (T < 650 °c) the Haven ratio was found to be 0.33. To investigate this change in the Haven ratio, protonic transport was examined using ac impedance measurements in dry and wet atmospheres.},

These materials are needed for application in a new generation of more efficient and durable solid state electrochemical devices such as reduced-temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC's). Recently published results have claimed that sputtered yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ)/SrTiO3 (STO) heterostructures show enhanced oxygen ion conductivity, by about eight orders of magnitude, with respect to that expected for YSZ and STO bulk values. The YSZ/STO heterostructures obtained in this work from Pulsed Laser Deposited (PLD) films, also show enhanced conductivity of a similar order. However, the fact that our structures show different relative orientations indicates that the conductivity enhancement may not be associated to a particular crystallographic arrangement at the interface. The combined characterisation of the conductivity dependence on oxygen partial pressure and direct oxygen diffusion by means of tracer experiments clearly demonstrate that the enhancement observed is related to the electronic rather than ionic conductivity.

abstract = {High temperature solid oxide fuel cells ( SOFCs), typi. ed by developers such as Siemens Westinghouse and Rolls- Royce, operate in the temperature region of 850-1000 degrees C. For such systems, very high e. ciencies can be achieved from integration with gas turbines for large- scale stationary applications. However, high temperature operation means that the components of the stack need to be predominantly ceramic and high temperature metal alloys are needed for many balance- of- plant components. For smaller scale applications, where integration with a heat engine is not appropriate, there is a trend to move to lower temperatures of operation, into the so- called intermediate temperature (IT) range of 500-750 degrees C. This expands the choice of materials and stack geometries that can be used, o. ering reduced system cost and, in principle, reducing the corrosion rate of stack and system components. This review introduces the IT- SOFC and explains the advantages of operation in this temperature regime. The main advances made in materials chemistry that have made IT operation possible are described and some of the engineering issues and the new opportunities that reduced temperature operation a. ords are discussed. This tutorial review examines the advances being made in materials and engineering that are allowing solid oxide fuel cells to operate at lower temperature. The challenges and advantages of operating in the so- called ` intermediate temperature' range of 500 - 750 degrees C are discussed and the opportunities for applications not traditionally associated with solid oxide fuel cells are highlighted. This article serves as an introduction for scientists and engineers interested in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells and the challenges and opportunities of reduced temperature operation.},

This composite is the precursor material of the cermet YSZ/Ni, which is used as solid oxide fuel cell anode material. The performance of the anode is strongly dependent on the microstructural properties of the cermet. Therefore, the control of the microstructure of the YSZ/NiO composite is a key step for the fabrication of high-performance anodes. In this study, the composites were prepared by a modified liquid mixture technique. Scanning electron microscopy analysis evidenced the good dispersion of the phases and that NiO nanoparticles are spread over the YSZ surface. Sintered pellets were studied by X-ray diffraction and impedance spectroscopy. The main results show that the composite is comprised of a well-dispersed mixture of the two phases. The electrical conductivity data show that there is a strong dependence of the transport mechanism on the relative composition of phases. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Y-doped barium zirconate (BZY) is a widely investigated proton conducting electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell applications. Yttrium is generally recognized as the most suitable dopant into the barium zirconate structure to achieve proper proton conductivity. The influence of Y concentration on the BZY electrical properties is here investigated. Single phase BaZr1-xYxO3-$\delta$ powders were obtained using a wet chemistry process in a wide compositional range (0.2 ≤ x ≤ 0.5). Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis suggested complete Y solubility into the BZY powders for all the tested compositions. Proton concentration as a function of Y content was evaluated in the 200-800 °C temperature range using thermogravimetric analysis performed under a water partial pressure of ∼ 0.03 atm. The larger the Y content, the larger the proton concentration. By means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the electrical conductivity of BZY sintered pellets was measured under humidified 10% H2/Ar atmosphere. Despite the increase in defect concentration, the conductivity decreased with increasing the Y concentration, due to both hindered mobility and reduced charge carrier concentration. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Discussed here is a strategy for selecting perovskite-based solid electrolytes with the potential for achieving high ionic conductivities at intermediate temperatures (≈600 °C). Activation energies for anionictransport (either O2-or proton) have been shown to be influenced by: (1) the average metal-oxygen bond energy in the perovskite, (2) the lattice free volumes, obtained by subtracting the ionic volumes of cations and O2-in the unit cell volume, (3) the parameter rcritical(rc) which corresponds to the radius of the opening between the two A-site cation and one B-site cation through which the mobile anion must pass, and (4) the lattice polarizability. Low activation energeis for anion migration appear to favor: (1) that the overall lattice possess a moderate metal-oxygen binding energy, (2) perovskite solid electrolytes possess free volumes of 30-35{\AA}3, (3) that the lattice minimally polarizes the mobile anion, and (4) preferred ( rcriticalr2-0)2ratios for A-A-B saddle points ≅0.5 High ionic conductivities have also been achieved for the perovskite-related brownmillerites A2B2O5which possess a high intrinsic population of anion vacancies in their lattice.

abstract = {Computer simulation techniques have been used to investigate the defect chemistry of perovskite-structured ionic conductors based upon AZrO(3)(A = Ca, Ba) and LaMO(3)(M = Sc, Ga). Our studies have examined dopant site-selectivity, oxide ion migration and dopant-defect association at the atomic level. The energetics of dopant incorporation in AZrO(3) show strong correlation with ion size. We predict Y(3+) to be one of the most favourable dopants for BaZrO(3) on energetic grounds, which accords with experimental work where this cation is the commonly used acceptor dopant for effective proton conduction. Binding energies for hydroxy-dopant pairs in BaZrO(3) are predicted to be favourable with the magnitude of the association increasing along the series Y < Yb < In < Sc. This suggests that proton mobility would be very sensitive to the type of acceptor dopant ion particularly at higher dopant levels. Oxygen vacancy migration in LaScO(3) is via a curved pathway around the edge of the ScO(6) octahedron. Dopant-vacancy clusters comprised of divalent dopants (Sr, Ca) at the La site have significant binding energies in LaScO(3), but very low energies in LaGaO(3). This points to greater trapping of the oxygen vacancies in doped LaScO(3), perhaps leading to higher activation energies at increasing dopant levels in accord with the available conductivity data.},

abstract = {Biphasic calcium phosphates comprising well-controlled mixtures of nonresorbable hydroxyapatite and other resorbable calcium phosphate phases often exhibit a combination of enhanced bioactivity and mechanical stability that is difficult to achieve in single-phase materials. This makes these biphasic bioceramics promising substrate materials for applications in bone tissue regeneration and repair. In this paper we report the synthesis of highly crystalline, biphasic coatings of hydroxyapatite/tetracalcium phosphate with control over the weight fraction of the constituent phases. The coatings were produced by pulsed laser deposition using ablation targets of pure crystalline hydroxyapatite. The fraction of tetracalcium phosphate phase in the coatings was controlled by varying the substrate temperature and the partial pressure of water vapor in the deposition chamber. A systematic study of phase composition in the hydroxyapatite/tetracalcium phosphate biphasic coatings was performed with X-ray diffraction. Tetracalcium phosphate in the coatings obtained at high substrate temperature is not formed by partial conversion of previously deposited hydroxyapatite. Instead, it is produced by nucleation and growth of tetracalcium phosphate itself from the ablation products of the hydroxyapatite target or by accretion of tetracalcium phosphate grains formed during ablation. This finding was confirmed by formation of calcium oxide, not tetracalcium phosphate, after annealing of pure hydroxyapatite coatings at high temperatures of 700-850°C. {\textcopyright} 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.},

The influence of the masses of the various atoms on the effective frequency is investigated. It is shown that an effective mass which depends on the direction of the path through the saddle point in configuration space determines this frequency. In the case of chemical diffusion by the vacancy mechanism the effective mass is approximately the same as the mass of the solute atom, and must always lie between the mass of the solute and the mass of the solvent. It is finally shown that the classical rate theory, even with many-body considerations, is unable to explain the recent observations of Lazarus and Okkerse on the isotope effect in the diffusion of iron in silver. {\textcopyright} 1957.},

Complex non-linear weighted regression of Voigt elements was applied to synthetic impedance data to identify the influence of stochastic noise and incomplete frequency ranges on the ability to resolve the expected distribution. The method was also applied to analysis of impedance data for heat-separated human stratum corneum. Regression of a Voigt series was found to provide a convenient way to identify a distribution of relaxation time constants corresponding to a given experimental spectrum. While the presence of stochastic noise reduces the number of Voigt elements that can be resolved, the parameters trace the same profile for the distribution of time constants. The technique should be particularly useful for experimental systems for which no deterministic model is available. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {High temperature proton conductor (HTPC) oxides are attracting extensive attention as electrolyte materials alternative to oxygen-ion conductors for use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operating at intermediate temperatures (400-700 degrees C). The need to lower the operating temperature is dictated by cost reduction for SOFC pervasive use. The major stake for the deployment of this technology is the availability of electrodes able to limit polarization losses at the reduced operation temperature. This review aims to comprehensively describe the state-of-the-art anode and cathode materials that have so far been tested with HTPC oxide electrolytes, offering guidelines and possible strategies to speed up the development of protonic SOFCs.},

abstract = {In this review the phenomenon of proton conductivity in materials and the elements of proton conduction mechanismssproton transfer, structural reorganization and diffusional motion of extended moietiessare discussed with special emphasis on proton chemistry. This is characterized by a strong proton localization within the valence electron density of electronegative species (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen) and self-localization effects due to solvent interactions which allows for significant proton diffusivities only when assisted by the dynamics of the proton environment in Grotthuss and vehicle type mechanisms. In systems with high proton density, proton/proton interactions lead to proton ordering below first-order phase transition rather than to coherent proton transfers along extended hydrogen-bond chains as is frequently suggested in textbooks of physical chemistry. There is no indication for significant proton tunneling in fast proton conduction phenomena for which almost barrierless proton transfer is suggested to occur. Models of proton conductivity are applied to specific compounds comprising oxides, phosphates, sulfates, and water-containing systems. The importance of proton conductivity is emphasized for biological systems and in devices such as fuel cells, electrochemical sensors, electrochemical reactors, and electro-chromic devices.},

abstract = {Thin film electrolytes/electrodes supported on porous substrates are needed for micro-SOFC (Solid Oxide Fuel Cell). In this study, we have tested the possible use of GDC (Gd2O3-doped CeO2) thin film as an electrolyte by measuring the open-circuit voltage (OCV) and power density of the cell. Anodic nano-porous alumina membrane was used as a porous, supporting substrate onto which the porous Pt thin film as an anode was deposited. GDC thin film (∼ 2 $\mu$m) was deposited on the top of the Pt anode by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). In order to measure the conductivity of GDC film and the power density of the cell, another Pt electrode as a cathode was painted on the surface of the GDC thin film. The measured OCV was lower than the theoretical OCV below 600 °C, however, close to the bulk GDC value. Thus, much of the reduced OCV at or below 500 °C was possibly attributed to the low catalytic activity of Pt electrodes. Enhanced OCV and power density are expected for the electrodes using highly active materials. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A new series of compounds with general chemical Formula Ba3-xKxHx(PO4)(2) has been successfully prepared. This particular stoichiometry was targeted as a candidate solid-state proton conductor because of its anticipated structural similarity to known M3H(XO4)(2) superprotonic conductors (M = Cs, Rb, NH4, K; X = Se, S)(1) and to the known trigonal compound Ba-3(PO4)(2).(2) The materials were synthesized from aqueous solution using barium acetate, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, and potassium hydroxide as starting materials. Through variations in the initial solution stoichiometry or the synthesis temperature, the final stoichiometry could be controlled from x similar to 0.5 to similar to 1. X-ray powder diffraction, energy dispersive spectroscopy chemical analysis, H-1 magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis were all employed to establish potassium and proton incorporation. The diffraction data confirmed crystallization of a trigonal phase, and chemical analysis showed the (Ba+K):P ratio to be 3:2, consistent with the target stoichiometry. The conductivity of the Ba3-xKxHx(PO4)(2) materials, as measured by A.C. impedance spectroscopy, is about 3 orders of magnitude greater than the end-member Ba-3(PO4)(2), material with only a slight dependence on x, however, it is substantially lower than that of typical superprotonic conductors and of the M3H(XO4)(2) materials in particular. The close proximity of Ba to the hydrogen bond site is proposed to explain this behavior. At 250 degrees C, the conductivity is similar to 2.4 x 10(-5) S/cm for the composition x=0.80, which, when combined with the water insolubility and the relatively high thermal stability, may render Ba3-xKxHx(PO4)(2) an attractive alternative in selected electrochemical applications to known superprotonic conductors.},

abstract = {Fuel cells are uniquely capable of overcoming combustion efficiency limitations (e.g., the Carnot cycle). However, the linking of fuel cells (an energy conversion device) and hydrogen (an energy carrier) has emphasized investment in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells as part of a larger hydrogen economy and thus relegated fuel cells to a future technology. In contrast, solid oxide fuel cells are capable of operating on conventional fuels (as well as hydrogen) today. The main issue for solid oxide fuel cells is high operating temperature (about 800°C) and the resulting materials and cost limitations and operating complexities (e.g., thermal cycling). Recent solid oxide fuel cells results have demonstrated extremely high power densities of about 2 watts per square centimeter at 650°C along with flexible fueling, thus enabling higher efficiency within the current fuel infrastructure. Newly developed, high-conductivity electrolytes and nanostructured electrode designs provide a path for further performance improvement at much lower temperatures, down to ∼350°C, thus providing opportunity to transform the way we convert and store energy.},

The unfavorably high grain boundary impedances and brittleness of ceramics have been reduced by forming solid solutions with small amounts of BaCeO3, and an initial fuel cell test has demonstrated that proton-conducting electrolytes based on Y-doped BaZrO3 provide alternatives for separator materials in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). These materials have the potential to operate at lower temperatures compared with those of conventional SOFCs, and the appearance of chemical water diffusion across the electrolyte at typical operation temperatures (T = 500–800◦C) allows the use of dry methane as a fuel.},

The membranes were nominally about 100 nm thick and were fabricated by both atomic layer deposition (ALD) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) techniques on micromachined Si substrates. Electrochemical cells (H(2), Pt/BYZ/Pt, air) were fabricated using porous platinum electrodes deposited by sputtering. The cells were tested in the temperature regime 200-450 degrees C. Power densities of 136 mW/cm(2) at 400 degrees C employing a BYZ membrane fabricated by ALD and 120 mW/cm(2) at 450 degrees C employing a BYZ fabricated by PLD clearly represent the highest reported values in the literature at these temperatures. The difference in the cell performances for the ALD BYZ versus PLD BYZ membranes is attributed to differences in their surface morphology and interfacial microstructure.},

abstract = {The environmental benefits of fuel cells have been increasingly appreciated in recent years. Among candidate electrolytes for solid-oxide fuel cells, yttrium-doped barium zirconate has garnered attention because of its high proton conductivity, particularly in the intermediate-temperature region targeted for cost-effective solid-oxide fuel cell operation, and its excellent chemical stability. However, fundamental questions surrounding the defect chemistry and macroscopic proton transport mechanism of this material remain, especially in regard to the possible role of proton trapping. Here we show, through a combined thermogravimetric and a.c. impedance study, that macroscopic proton transport in yttrium-doped barium zirconate is limited by proton-dopant association (proton trapping). Protons must overcome the association energy, 29 kJ mol(-1), as well as the general activation energy, 16 kJ mol(-1), to achieve long-range transport. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance studies show the presence of two types of proton environment above room temperature, reflecting differences in proton-dopant configurations. This insight motivates efforts to identify suitable alternative dopants with reduced association energies as a route to higher conductivities.},

They have been used to construct laboratory scale fuel cells, which, in addition to performance data, have provided an unexpected insight into the transport processes operating in these materials. In the temperature range of 600-1000°C, the dominant transport process varies from protonic to oxide-ion dominated. This transition has been confirmed by measurement of water vapour transfer in a cell in which the perovskite is exposed to wet hydrogen on both sides. The evolution of transport properties with temperature is discussed in relation to structure. Neutron diffraction studies of doped and undoped barium cerate are reported, revealing a series of phase transitions between ambient temperature and 1000°C. The available literature on chemical stability of cerate perovskites to reduction and attack by carbon dioxide is reviewed in brief. Keywords:},

The inability to fabricate reliable triple-phase-boundary (tbp) structures involving electrolytes, electronic conductors, and gaseous reactants, severely restricted the progress of fuel cells until about four decades ago (∼1960). However at the start of the new millennium, commercialisation of four fuel cell types: polymeric electrolyte membrane (PEMFC), phosphoric acid (PAFC), molten carbonate (MCFC), and solid oxide (SOFC), is now being very energetically pursued. Materials selection for each type of fuel cell is briefly examined, and the predominant engineering issues related to the development of commercial products are summarised. The fabrication, reliability, and cost of the relevant materials is of paramount importance to ensure rapid market penetration. The choice of fuel and relevant infrastructure is also considered, and the crucial role of materials for energy storage (particularly hydrogen) and fuel processing, is emphasised.},

Despite our progress, a crucial point still seems to be the ability and computer power required to understand and model the complex quantum mechanical proton transfer process. Many of the commercial prospects are closely connected with the need for cleaner energy technologies and the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier. In particular, polymer-based proton conductors are quickly approaching the market for small fuel cells and electrolysers: from bench-scale demonstration units for hydrogen energy to automobiles. There is also emerging interest in mixed protonic–electronic conductors for use as hydrogen permeable membranes in hydrogen separation technologies.

The experimental data indicate that the studied ethanol-fueled SOFCs have comparable performance. However, different ceramic matrix and metallic phase composition of cermets result in different behavior of the ethanol direct oxidation. Below 800 degrees C, the performance of fuel cells is relatively more stable as compared to higher temperatures, but the catalytic activity for ethanol conversion of doped ceria is insufficient to prevent carbon formation. The experimental results provide evidence for the importance of an appropriate combination of fuel, operating conditions, and anode materials in designing SOFCs for direct operation using ethanol as fuel.

abstract = {Proton motions in hydrated proton conducting perovskites BaZr0.90A0.10O2.95(A = Y and Sc) have been investigated using quasielastic neutron scattering. The results reveal a localized motion on the ps time scale and with an activation energy of $\sim$ 10-30 meV, in both materials. The temperature dependence of the total mean square displacement of the protons shows an onset of this motion at a temperature of about 300 K. The low activation energy, much lower than the activation energy for the macroscopic proton conductivity, suggests that this motion is not the rate-limiting process for the long-range proton diffusion, i.e. it is not linked to the two materials significantly different proton conductivities. In fact, a comparison of the QENS results with density functional theory calculations indicates that for both materials the observed motion may be ascribed to intra-octahedral proton transfers occurring close to a dopant atom. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Highly dense SDC and GDC samples (96\%) with reduced grain size (150 nm) were obtained by f.f. even at 1300°-1400°C and, unexpectedly, high electrical conductivity and low blocking effect at grain boundary was obtained. Conventionally sintered samples showed that the grain boundary resistivity decreased with increasing the grain size, in agreement with the increase in geometrical bulk volume/grain boundary area ratio. Conversely, f.f. samples showed grain boundary resistivity smaller for small grain size. The above effect was observed only for high dopant ( > 10\% molar) contents.

abstract = {Effects of small amounts of Fe doping for Ga site in LaGaO 3 -based oxide on oxide ion conductivity is investigated in this study. It is found that doping a small amount of Fe is effective for improving the oxide ion conductivity in La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Ga 0.8 Mg 0.2 O 3 (LSGM). The highest oxide ion conductivity was exhibited at x = 0.03 in La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Ga 0.8 Mg 0.2-x Fe x O 3 among the Fe-doped samples. Electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements suggest that Fe is trivalent in LaGaO 3 lattice. The application of the Fe-doped LaGaO 3 -based oxide for the electrolyte of solid oxide fuel cell was further investigated. Power density of the solid oxide fuel cell was increased by using Fe-doped LSGM for electrolyte. This can be explained by the decrease in electrical resistance loss by improving the oxide ion conductivity. A maximum power density close to 700 mW/cm 2 was obtained at 1073 K on the cell using 0.5 mm thick La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Ga 0.8 Mg 0.17 Fe 0.03 O 3 (LSGMF) and O 2 as the electrolyte and the oxidant, respectively. Therefore, close to the theoretical open-circuit potential was exhibited by the LSGMF cell. On the other hand, the power density was slightly smaller than that of the cell using Co-doped LSGM as electrolyte, especially, at temperatures lower than 973 K. This may result from the large activation energy for ion conductivity. However, the power density of the LSGMF cell was higher than that of the LSGM cell. Therefore, LSGM doped with a small amount of Fe is a promising electrolyte similar to Co-doped LSGM for the intermediate solid oxide fuel cell.},

abstract = {For investigating the direct applicability of highly active cobalt containing cathodes on YSZ electrolytes at a lower processing and operating temperature range (T <= 650 degrees C), we fabricated a thin film lanthanum strontium cobalt oxide (LSC) cathode on an yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ)-based solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) via pulsed laser deposition (PLD). Its electrochemical performance (5.9 mW cm(-2) at 0.7 V, 650 degrees C) was significantly inferior to that (595 mW cm(-2) at 0.7 V, 650 degrees C) of an SOFC with a thin (t similar to 200 nm) gadolinium doped ceria (GDC) buffer layer in between the LSC thin film cathode and the YSZ electrolyte. It implies that even though the cathode processing and cell operating temperatures were strictly controlled not to exceed 650 degrees C, the direct application of LSC on YSZ should be avoided. The origin of the cell performance deterioration is thoroughly studied by glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the decomposition of the cathode and diffusion of La and Sr into YSZ were observed when LSC directly contacted YSZ.},

@article{Navickas2012,
abstract = {Across-plane conductivity measurements on ion conducting thin films of a few ten nanometers thickness are challenging due to frequently occurring short-circuits through pinholes in the layer. In this contribution, a method is proposed which allowed across-plane conductivity measurements on yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) layers with thicknesses as low as 20 nm. YSZ layers were prepared onto silicon substrates with a thin native silica interlayer and the across-plane conductivity was measured on circular microelectrodes by impedance spectroscopy. The silica interlayer exhibits strongly blocking behavior, which helps to avoid short-circuits through pinholes. Different relaxation frequencies of YSZ and silica make separation of these layers possible. An equivalent circuit is suggested, which allows extraction of YSZ properties, and its validity is proven by varying microelectrodes size and layer thickness. All parameters yield the expected behavior. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Despite the superior bulk protonic conductivity combined with chemical stability in the temperature region in which intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) are operated, the use of polycrystalline ceramics of yttrium-doped barium zirconates (BZY) as a solid electrolyte is still largely limited mainly because the grain boundaries in these materials substantially increase the internal resistance. Hence the demand for better understanding of the origin of such high grain-boundary resistance in BZY has grown rapidly. It has long been speculated that the grain-boundary resistance may be attributed to the space charges formed at the grain boundaries. Here we present the results of our investigation on the space-charge effects on the grain-boundary conduction in BZY. We identify the width of the grain boundary as an independent parameter which allows for an unambiguous verification of the space-charge effects in BZY. By quantitatively comparing the values of the widths experimentally determined not only for the 5, 8, and 20 mol\% doped BZY samples we prepared but also for various other BZYs previously reported with those calculated based on a space-charge model, we have successfully verified that the grain-boundary conduction in these materials is indeed governed by the space charges.},

Finite element modeling is used to extract physical parameters from the experimental data, allowing not only quantification of the observed processes, but also decoupling of their contributions to the measured signal. The constructed phase diagrams of the parameters demonstrate a thermally activated proton injection reaction at the triple phase boundary, and two transport processes that are responsible for the low-temperature proton conductivity of nanostructured ceria.},

Their dependence on the nature and concentration of the dopant, and the degree of hydration provide evidence for (i) a strong relaxation around oxygen ion vacancies which decreases with increasing vacancy concentration and (ii) the absence of significant defect interaction even for high dopant concentrations. The attempt frequencies are consistent with a proton diffusion mechanism assisted by the local oxygen dynamics.

The anode is a sputtered platinum film and the cathode is made of a spray pyrolysis (SP)-deposited lanthanum strontium cobalt iron oxide (LSCF), a sputtered platinum film and platinum paste. A single-layer of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) made by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and a bilayer of PLD-YSZ and SP-YSZ are used as electrolytes. The total thickness of all layers is less than 1 mu m and the cell is a free-standing membrane with a diameter up to 200 mu m. The electrolyte resistance and the sum of polarization resistances of the anode and cathode are measured between 400 and 600 C by impedance spectroscopy and direct current (DC) techniques. The contribution of the electrolyte resistance to the total cell resistance is negligible for all cells. The area-specific polarization resistance of the electrodes decreases for different cathode materials in the order of Pt paste > sputtered Pt > LSCF. The open circuit voltages (OCVs) of the single-layer electrolyte cells ranges from 0.91 to 0.56 V at 550 degrees C. No electronic leakage in the PLD-YSZ electrolyte is found by in-plane and cross-plane electrical conductivity measurements and the low OCV is attributed to gas leakage through pinholes in the columnar microstructure of the electrolyte. By using a bilayer electrolyte of PLD-YSZ and SP-YSZ, an OCV of 1.06 V is obtained and the maximum power density reaches 152 mW cm(-2) at 550 degrees C.},

The equilibrium water uptake is determined by thermogravimetry, while combining thermogravimetry with differential scanning calorimetry allows for direct determination of the materials' hydration thermodynamics. Proton and oxide ion transport properties are characterized by means of ac impedance measurements up to 1000 °C. In general, the hydration thermodynamics of the scandates are more favorable than that of the indates and are also affected by changes in crystal structure throughout the series. The more favorable hydration thermodynamics of cubic scandates increase their proton conductivity at higher temperatures compared to their indate counterparts. In contrast to the BaTi1-xInxO3-x/2 series, the BaTi1-xScxO3-x/2 (0.5 ≤ x ≤ 0.7) materials retain their cubic structures upon full saturation by protons and show no signs of chemical instability upon exposure to 1 atm H2O(g) down to 100 °C.

The data analysis reveals that the activation enthalpy as well as the activation entropy of grain conductivity are significantly higher in comparison with grain-boundary conductivity. It may be concluded that BAUERLE's electrical equivalent circuit which underlies the interpretation of dispersive type measurements aiming at separate determination of grain and grain-boundary conductivity ought to be revised. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {Sintered targets of ZrO2 and Al2O3 are ablated by KrF excimer laser radiation. The processing gas atmosphere consists of O2 at pressures of 0.1-50Pa. The films of 100nm-10$\mu$m in thickness are deposited on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polycarbonate (PC) and glass (fused silica) substrates. Analytical techniques used for the determination of structural characteristics of the films are optical and electron microscopy. The thickness and the complex refractive index are determined by ellipsometry. The optical film thickness, reflectivity and transmittivity of the films at different wavelengths are determined in situ and ex situ using optical spectroscopy. The hardness and elastic modulus of the films are investigated using nano-indentation. The investigations concentrate on the influence of the oxygen pressure, the target-to-substrate distance and the laser fluence on the refractive index of the films, which is correlated with the film density. The compaction of the films is achieved by particles impinging with kinetic energies above 30eV on the growing surface. Dense (94% of the bulk density), transparent and hard (Vickers hardness 1200, elastic modulus 190GPa) alumina films 2-10$\mu$m in thickness have been deposited on glass substrates. Alumina films thicker than 500nm deposited on PMMA or PC substrates delaminate due to large compressive stress in the films. Multilayer systems of alumina and zirconia are deposited on micro-optics of PMMA, as antireflective coatings in the spectral range $\lambda$=800-900nm yielding a transmittance 99%. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.},

Materials cost and processing, together with durability issues, are emphasized as these now dominate materials selection processes for prototype stack units. In addition to optimizing the cell components, increasing attention is being given to the composition and processing of the bipolar plate component as the weight and volume of the relevant material has a major influence on the overall power density and cost of the fuel cell stack. It is concluded that the introduction of alternative materials/processes that would enable PEMFC stacks to operate at 150–200 • C, and IT-SOFC stacks to operate at 500–700 • C, would have a major impact on the successful commercialization of fuel cell technology.},

abstract = {The mobility and stability of protonic defects in acceptor-doped perovskite-type oxides (ABO3) in the system SrTiO3-SrZrO3-BaZrO3-BaTiO3have been examined experimentally and by computational simulations. These materials have the potential to combine high proton conductivity and thermodynamic stability. While any structural and chemical perturbation originating from the B-site occupation (poor chemical matching of the acceptor-dopant or Zr/Ti-mixing) leads to a significant reduction of the mobility of protonic defects, Sr/Ba-mixing on the A-site appears to be less critical. The stability of protonic defects is found to essentially scale with the basicity of the lattice oxygen, which is influenced by both A- and B-site occupations. The highest proton conductivities are observed for acceptor-doped BaZrO3. Despite its significantly higher ionic radius compared to Zr4+, Y3+is found to be optimal as an acceptor dopant for BaZrO3. Mulliken population analysis shows that Y does not change the oxide's basicity (i.e. it chemically matches on the Zr-site of BaZrO3). The highest proton conductivities have been observed for high Y-dopant concentrations (15-20 mol%). For temperatures below about 700°C, the observed proton conductivities clearly exceed the oxide ion conductivities of the best oxide ion conductors. The high conductivity and thermodynamic stability make these materials interesting alternatives for oxide ion conductors such as Y-stabilized zirconia, which are currently used as separator material for high drain electrochemical applications, such as solid oxide fuel cells. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Impressive performance was obtained with small-scale PCFCs at moderate temperatures.

abstract = {The structures of the three ferroelectric phases of BaTiO3 have been determined by Rietveld refinement using powder diffraction data collected at a spallation neutron source. The correlation between refined atomic displacements and thermal parameters, which has hampered previous structure determinations, has been partially alleviated by using data which extend over a wide range of d spacings. Data collected at a large number of sample temperatures provide information about the temperature dependence of the ferroelectric displacements and changes in the oxygen octahedra which surround the Ti ions. The temperature dependence of the thermal parameters gives atomic Debye-Waller temperatures that are remarkably similar to those for the cations in the high-T(c) superconductors. Our results are insensitive to predictions of a soft-mode displacive model; however, values of the anisotropic thermal parameters do not support the order-disorder model suggested by Comes et al. Powder extinction and profile coefficients from the structural refinements show pronounced minima and maxima, respectively, near the phase transitions and provide information about the temperature dependence of the mosaic structure and the strain in the different phases.},

The high degree of control of the performance characteristics undoubtedly forms an important argument in favour of conductivity-based sensing. The paper provides an outline of the design rules to be followed if an optimal design of a planar conductivity cell is required. Based on a simplified model, it is shown that the required accuracy establishes a lower limit to the overall sensor dimensions. This lower limit is expressed as a minimum longitudinal path length necessary to obtain the desired accuracy. Given an available area, the optimum ratio of electrode-width over inter-electrode spacing for a basic two-electrode structure is shown to be close to unity. Furthermore, it is shown that the decomposition of the two electrodes into an interdigitated structure decreases the accuracy of the device if all other parameters are considered constant. If the sensing region has to be limited to within a thin sensitive layer, the splitting is proposed of one of the electrodes into a compound electrode. The optimum lay-out of this compound structure is calculated as a function of the layer thickness.},

abstract = {During polarisation of dense PLD Pt film electrodes on YSZ changes in the morphology of the anode appeared involving a pronounced electrode activation. These morphology changes or more precisely the formation of bubbles and their cracking were explained by a built up of gas pressure underneath the Pt film due to the evolving oxygen. For the first time a detailed study of this phenomenon was presented, including a characterisation by HRSEM, AFM, in situ optical rnicroscopy, XRD and electrochemical measurements. The appearance and the shape of different kinds of bubbles were discussed and an internal pressure was estimated by using simple geometrical models. A diffusion of oxygen along the interface Pt/YSZ was evidenced. The observed electrode activation was related to an extension of the tpb length during the formation and cracking of the bubbles. A comparison of dense electrodes to differently prepared porous ones clearly showed that a morphology change due to overpressure only occurs on extended gas-tight electrode areas and thus, need not be considered when using sintered paste electrodes.

abstract = {Laser ablation deposition of highly oriented yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) films is important for various technological applications and depends critically on the selection of background environment, with low pressure oxygen being the most common choice. Here, the spatial-temporal distribution of YSZ plume chemistry, excitation states, and energy was determined for ablations in vacuum, low pressure O-2, and low pressure Ar, using fluorescence analyses, element specific imaging techniques, and time-of-flight experiments. It was found that an Ar background considerably promotes excitation and ionization of zirconium during the first 1-3 mu s after the laser strike. There is much less zirconium excitation in an O-2 background, where a large fraction of atomic oxygen with a broad spatial distribution was found. ZrO and YO molecules were observed in both environments. Their highest concentrations were in the O-2 background, where fluorescence from these molecules near the substrate lasted for 2-5 mu s. Neutral species in YSZ plumes were fitted to Maxwellian type velocity distributions with a shifted center of mass. Kinetic energies derived from the fitted data were reduced by about a factor of 2 in Ar and O-2 backgrounds compared to in vacuum. This was not observed for Zr1+ species, which maintained about 100-120 eV mean kinetic energy nearly independently of the background. The ionization of Zr in the presence of Ar, the high velocity of ionized Zr atoms relative to the rest of the plume, the generation of molecular ZrO, YO, and atomic oxygen in the presence of O-2 are potentially important for chemistry and structure control of YSZ films.

abstract = {Fuel cells electrochemically convert chemical energy in fuels into electrical energy (and heat) and so can produce power efficiently with low environmental impact. Applications of fuel cells include stationary power generation, distributed combined heat and power (CHP) and portable power. Recently, research has been conducted on direct carbon fuel cell (DCFC) technology that converts the chemical energy in solid carbon directly into electricity. This article discusses these technologies and their development status. For small-to medium-sized stationary power systems and CHP, the USA ranks first for fuel cell capacity and Japan leads for delivery systems. South Korea is home to the world's largest fuel cell power plant: the 59-MW Gyeonggi Green Energy park in Hwasung City. Deployment of fuel cell systems is driven by support from governments in the form of tax credits and other incentives. For large stationary power generation, current interest is in integrating a coal gasification process with high-temperature fuel cells (IGFC) to create ultra-high-efficiency, low-emissions power generation systems. The first IGFC demonstration plant with CCS may be in Japan in 2021 as a result of the CoolGen project. DCFC is still in its infancy and far from demonstration. The overall challenges for stationary fuel cells are cost and cell durability. Experience gained from research, designing, building and operating commercially available systems and the IGFC demonstration plant should lead to further development of the technologies and reduced costs, making them a realistic option for power generation.},

BaCe0.9Gd0.1O2,95 and some related compounds display a transition from protonic to oxide ion conduction, at 600 to 1000°C. While the oxide ion conductivity increases with temperature, the protonic component displays a maximum, apparently due to the combined increase in mobility and depletion of carriers. The above transition may also partly explain the difference in activation energy displayed by D2O and H2O exchanged materials in this temperature range, an effect previously ascribed to tunnelling conduction. Finally, a high-temperature study of conductivity if BaCe0.9Gd0.1O2.95 as a function of oxygen partial pressure has been performed, enabling individual ionic, p- and n-type electronic components to be resolved and their temperature dependence studied. These results relate to the applications of high-temperature protonic conductors in fuel cells and other electrochemical devices.},

abstract = {In this work, barium zirconate (BaZrO3) ceramics synthesized by solid state reaction method and sintered at 1670°C for 4h were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Rietveld refinement, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. XRD patterns, Rietveld refinement data and FT-IR spectra which confirmed that BaZrO3 ceramics have a perovskite-type cubic structure. Optical properties were investigated by ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. UV–vis absorption spectra suggested an indirect allowed transition with the existence of intermediary energy levels within the band gap. Intense visible green PL emission was observed in BaZrO3 ceramics upon excitation with a 350nm wavelength. This behavior is due to a majority of deep defects within the band gap caused by symmetry breaking in octahedral [ZrO6] clusters in the lattice. The microwave dielectric constant and quality factor were measured using the method proposed by Hakki–Coleman. The dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) was investigated experimentally and numerically using a monopole antenna through an infinite ground plane and Ansoft's high frequency structure simulator software, respectively. The required resonance frequency and bandwidth of DRA were investigated by adjusting the dimension of the same material.},

abstract = {Using cost-effective precursors of BaCO3, ZrO2, and Y2O3, proton conducting ceramic pellets of BaZr0.8Y0.2O3 - ?? (BZY20) were successfully fabricated with the help of a range of sintering aids including LiF, NiO, Al2O3, and SnO2. This simple and cost-effective solid-state reactive sintering (SSRS) method involved only a single high-temperature sintering step. The effect of various experimental conditions on the crystal structure, relative density, morphology, and total conductivity of the as-prepared BZY20 ceramic pellets were investigated in detail. Tunable experimental parameters included the type of sintering aid, the amount of aid, and the sintering temperature. NiO was determined to be the most effective sintering aid investigated. Under optimized conditions using 1-2 wt.% NiO as a sintering aid, dense BZY20 ceramic pellets (> 95% relative density) with grain sizes as large as 5 ??m were successfully prepared at a relatively low sintering temperature of 1400 ??C. In comparison, most alternative sintering techniques for BZY require temperatures in excess of 1700 ??C. Total conductivities as high as 2.2 ?? 10- 2 and 3.3 ?? 10- 2 S cm- 1 were obtained from the resulting pellets at 600 ??C under dry- and wet-argon atmospheres respectively. These are among the highest values reported for BZY20, highlighting the potential of the NiO-modified reactive sintering approach to provide a simple, cost-effective, reduced-temperature route to achieve dense, large-grained parts for protonic-ceramic applications. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

By in situ reduction, the substrate was changed to a porous Ni-Fe alloy metal. The volumetric shrinkage and porosity of the substrate were also studied systematically with the Ni-Fe substrate reduced at different temperatures. A Sr and Mg-doped LaGaO3 (LSGM) thin film was prepared on dense substrate by the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. The LSGM film with stoichiometric composition was successfully prepared under optimal deposition parameters and a target composition. Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (SSC55) cathode was prepared by the slurry coating method on the deposited film. Prepared SOFC single cell shows high power density and the maximum power density (MPD) achieved was 1.79, 0.82 and 0.29 W cm(-2) at 973, 873 and 773K, respectively. After thermal cycle from 973 to 298K. the cell shows almost theoretical open circuit potential (1.1 V) and the power density of 1.62W cm(-2), which is almost the same as that at first cycles. Therefore, the Ni-Fe porous metal support made by the selective reduction is highly promising as a metal anode substrate for SOFC using LaGaO3 thin film. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This model was developed from a recent high resolution QENS experiment using cold neutrons, with the first state representing free diffusion of the protons (jumping from oxygen to oxygen forming OH− ; free state) and the second state representing protons trapped on energetically lowered sites (nearby an Yb3+ ion on a Ce4+ site; trapped state); into this model we integrate a very fast localized motion taking place in the free state as a reorientation of the OH− ions. This motion is visible as a broad quasielastic component in the neutron energy spectra and exhibits a very low activation energy.},

The grain size of one film was 300-500 nm, and the other was 30-50 nm. DC polarization and AC impedance measurements were performed at 873 K-1073 K in O-2-gas mixtures. From investigations of the electrochemical capacitances, the rate determining process for both electrodes were confirmed to be the surface reaction. The analyses in the electrochemical resistance revealed that the oxygen adsorption/desorption rate was faster on the electrode with smaller grain size. DC responses agreed with AC results, so the current density on the nano-grain electrode was larger by half an order than those of the sub-micron-grain electrode. Under a dilute oxygen atmosphere, the rate determining step transferred from a surface reaction to a gas phase diffusion. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The solubility of In, Yb, Tm, Er, and Ho, whose ionic radii are close to that of zirconium ion, into the B site is more than 0.075 (XMO1.5 =0.075) at 1600°C. In contrast, when there is a large difference of ionic radii between trivalent cations (Nd3+, La3+, Bi3+, and Ga3+) and zirconium ion, the solubility of trivalent cations into barium zirconate is less than XMO1.5 =0.075. The microstructure of sintered pellets and their conductivity in wet atmosphere were investigated. We could divide dopants into two classes based on the extent of proton conductivity and microstructure: "Y-type" and "Sc-type" dopants. Yb, Ho, Er, and Tm belong to Y-type dopants, which have a microstructural mixture of coarse and fine grains and higher proton conductivity. In belongs to Sc-type dopants, which have well-grown grains and lower proton conductivity. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Electrochemical Society.},

Emphasis is placed on the relationship between structural and mechanistic features of the crystalline materials and their ion conduction properties. After describing well-established classes such as fluorite- and perovskite-based oxides, new materials and structure-types are presented. These include a variety of molybdate, gallate, apatite silicate/germanate and niobate systems, many of which contain flexible structural networks, and exhibit different defect properties and transport mechanisms to the conventional materials. It is concluded that the rich chemistry of these important systems provides diverse possibilities for developing superior ionic conductors for use as solid electrolytes in fuel cells and related applications. In most cases, a greater atomic-level understanding of the structures, defects and conduction mechanisms is achieved through a combination of experimental and computational techniques (217 references). {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {The pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique has been applied for the epitaxial growth of ZnO for more than two decades. The emergence of high-temperature stability of the excitonic lasing was first demonstrated in a microcrystalline ZnO film grown by PLD leading to recent remarkable growth in this field. A number of attempts have been made to improve the crystallinity for realizing p-type materials in the quest for ZnO-based short wavelength light emitting devices (LEDs). In this paper, we describe practical advantages of PLD and currently accomplished intrinsic properties of ZnO films according to the abundant literature. We find that correlation between Hall mobility and lateral grain size captures the effect of grain boundaries for the films grown on sapphire substrates. On the other hand, advantages of the use of lattice-matched ScAlMgO 4  substrate are evidenced by the lower residual electron density, higher mobility and sharper exciton peaks in the photoluminescence and absorption spectra. We also focus on the wide-band-gap ternary alloy, Mg x Zn 1-x O, especially in terms of the composition dependence of its lattice parameters and band-gap in two different crystallographic phases, to discuss the stability of this metastable compound. The studies on the PLD growth of multilayer and superlattices are briefly reviewed. We finally present the current capability of electron and hole doping by incorporating Ga and N into films grown on (0001) ScAlMgO 4  substrates. We conclude that the PLD technique and related technologies have now matured to meet the requirements for fabricating UV-LEDs. {\textcopyright} 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Doped barium cerate perovskites are of interest as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells operating at 600–1000°C. Moreover, in this temperature range they display a transition from protonic to oxide ion conduction. In this study, the conductivity of BaCe0.9Gd0.1O2.95, previously reported only up to 800°C, was measured up to 1200°C using the a.c. van der Pauw technique. Data obtained in a range of atmospheres and plotted against log(PO2) displayed ionic, p-type and n-type components, which could be resolved by curve fitting to standard conductivity equations. The activation energies of the three components, estimated separately, were 0.52 eV for $\sigma$i, 0.64 eV for $\sigma$p and 2.6 eV for $\sigma$n. These parameters were used to calculate the ionic transport number under high PO2, and low PO2, conditions and to map out the compound's ionic domain. The ionic transport numbers obtained for low and high oxygen partial pressures have been compared to those measured previously using concentration cells.},

abstract = {Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) shows promising oxygen transport properties for the use as oxygen separation membranes and cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells. In order to evaluate the electrical conductivity properties as well as surface exchange coefficients without the influence of grain boundaries present in polycrystalline bulk samples, high-quality epitaxial BSCF thin films on single crystal NdGaO3 (110) (NGO) substrates were prepared for the first time. This was achieved by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) using single-phase cubic targets sintered from powder prepared via the mixed oxide route. Structural and compositional properties of the thin films were verified by various X-ray diffraction techniques as well as by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrical conductivity of the thin films was measured in dependence of temperature and compared to values obtained by measurements on polycrystalline bulk samples from the same powder as well as data from literature, showing different activation energies and higher general conductivity. Dependence of the conductivity on oxygen partial pressure has also been studied, revealing a rather small variation and indicating a possible phase change beginning to occur at oxygen partial pressures below 10(-4) bar. Additionally, the surface exchange coefficient k(Chem) of the purely surface exchange controlled samples was determined by a conductivity relaxation technique and yielded an activation energy of 93 kJ/mol.

An analysis of these data in the complex admittance plane indicated the presence of three polarizations: (1) an electrode polarization characterized by a double layer capacity and an effective resistance for the overall electrode reaction, 1/2 O2 (gas) + 2e (platinum) -> O2- (electrolyte); (2) a capacitive-resistive electrolyte polarization, probably corresponding to a partial blocking of oxvgen ions at the electrolyte grain boundaries by an impurity phase there; and (3) a pure ohmic eiectrolyte polarization.},

The system in this study is called the ONEBAT system and consists of the fuel cell PEN (positive electrode - electrolyte - negative electrode) element, a gas processing unit, and a thermal system. PEN elements of free-standing multi-layer membranes are fabricated on Foturan (R) and on Si substrates using thin film deposition and microfabrication techniques. Open circuit voltages of up to 1.06 V and power of 150 mW cm(-2) are achieved at 550 degrees C. The membranes are stable up to 600 degrees C. The gas processing unit allows butane conversion of 95% and hydrogen selectivity of 83% at 550 degrees C in the reformer and efficient after-burning of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and lower hydrocarbons in the post-combustor. Thermal system simulations prove that a large thermal gradient of more than 500 degrees C between the hot module and its exterior are feasible. The correlation between electrical power output - system size and thermal conductivity - heat-transfer coefficient of the thermal insulation material are shown. The system design studies show that the single sub-systems can be integrated into a complete system and that the requirements for portable electronic devices can be achieved with a base unit of 2.5 W and a modular approach.

abstract = {The solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) continues to show great promise for the generation of electricity for an increasing range of applications. The present SOFC technology is based on an all-ceramic design, which eliminates the corrosion problems associated with fuel cells containing liquid electrolytes. To obtain good electrochemical performance with the currently used materials, this all-ceramic fuel cell operates at 1000°C. Despite a significant amount of research and several successful demonstrations at the 100 kW level, commercialisation of the technology is not as rapid as anticipated. This is, in part, due to the high operating temperatures required, necessitating the use of expensive materials. As a result of these problems, there has been an effort over the past few years to lower the SOFC operating temperature. This paper will address the issues concerning the development of new materials that can operate at lower temperatures. Many of these issues have been or are being addressed in the research performed at Argonne National Laboratory, and some recent results will be discussed.},

This approach allows to reach unprecedented insights on the peculiar role of the dopant, and its interactions with the other lattice defects. In particular, we evidence that each different dopant shows unique behavior, depending mainly on its electronic structure, and that the usual criterion of ionic radius matching is not useful to outline an effective doping strategy of proton-conducting perovskites. As what concerns the structure-property relationships, we evidence that the high dopant solubility, the high symmetry around the doped site, and the low local disorder, are detrimental for proton conductivity. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The film thickness over the full film area has been determined by energy-dispersive Xray spectrometry in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with use of a method similar to one described by Bishop and Poole. The attenuation of the electron-induced X-rays from the Si wafer by the film was monitored at a number of points along a diameter and the thickness was determined by Monte Carlo simulations of the attenuation for various values of film thickness with the program CASINO. These results have been compared with direct measurements in the SEM of the film thickness on a cross-section on one of the wafers. The results of these measurements demonstrate the ability of this technique to accurately determine the thickness of a large film, i.e. up to diameters of 125 mm, in a relatively short time, without destroying the substrate, without the need of a standard sample and without the need of a flat substrate. We have also demonstrated that by controlling the deposition parameters large-area YSZ films with uniform thickness can be produced. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The global solutions to defect chemistry models, was discussed, with an emphasis on the p-type perovskite conductors, which are considered as the electrodes of SOFC. The global defect chemistry models allow better understanding and prediction of the electrochemical properties of p-type conductors.

The constants, calculated under the assumption of a negligible hole concentration, were found to be linear in the Arrhenius representation only at low temperatures (≤500 °C). Nonlinearity at high temperatures is attributed to the occurrence of electronic defects. The hydration enthalpies determined here range from ?22 to ?26 kJ mol?1 and are substantially smaller in magnitude than those reported previously. The difference is a direct result of the different temperature ranges employed, where previous studies have utilized higher temperature thermogravimetric measurements, despite the inapplicability of the assumption of a negligible hole concentration. The hydration entropies measured in this work, around ?40 J K?1 mol?1, are similarly smaller in magnitude than those previously reported and are considerably smaller than what would be expected from the complete loss of entropy of vapor-phase H2O upon dissolution. This result suggests that substantial entropy is introduced into the oxide as a consequence of the hydration. The hydration reaction constants are largely independent of yttrium concentration, in agreement with earlier reports.

The hydration entropies measured in this work, around ?40 J K?1 mol?1, are similarly smaller in magnitude than those previously reported and are considerably smaller than what would be expected from the complete loss of entropy of vapor-phase H2O upon dissolution. This result suggests that substantial entropy is introduced into the oxide as a consequence of the hydration. The hydration reaction constants are largely independent of yttrium concentration, in agreement with earlier reports.},

abstract = {Can new hybrid perovskites be predicted using the tolerance factor?The tolerance factor is a widely used predictor of perovskite stability. The recent interest in hybrid perovskites for use as solar cell absorbers has lead to application of the tolerance factor to these materials as a way to explain and predict structure. Here we critically assess the suitability of the tolerance factor for halide perovskites. We show that the tolerance factor fails to accurately predict the stability of the 32 known inorganic iodide perovskites, and propose an alternative method. We introduce a revised set of ionic radii for cations that is anion dependent, this revision is necessary due to increased covalency in metal–halide bonds for heavier halides compared with the metal-oxide and fluoride bonds used to calculate Shannon radii. We also employ a 2D structural map to account for the size requirements of the halide anions. Together these measures yield a simple system which may assist in the search for new hybrid and inorganic perovskites.},

However, it is difficult to sinter this type of material to high density. In order to overcome this problem and to study the material in form of a thin film we have used Pulsed Laser Deposition to obtain a dense, uniform film with the right stochiometry. Investigation of preparation-parameter dependence of the LSC films deposited on a stainless steel substrate during pulsed-laser deposition was carried out. The LSC films were deposited with KrF excimer laser (248 nm) on a stainless steel substrate at different oxygen pressure and substrate temperatures. The substrate temperature (873-1073 K) and the oxygen background pressure (5-20 Pa) were varied in order to obtain optimal growth conditions. The surface morphology and structural information of the films were obtained using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction, respectively. Under the optimal preparation-parameter conditions: substrate temperature of 1023 K and an oxygen pressure of 10 Pa the structure of the film agreed with the target structure and the SEM micrographs show that the surfaces are homogeneous, smooth, crack-free and dense.

At room temperature, the conductivity increases by 11 orders of magnitude with the addition of SWCNT to the YSZ. At high temperatures (>300 degrees C), the ionic conduction of the YSZ becomes relevant and a mixed ionic-electronic transport is observed. It is found that the transport can be described by a sum of two parallel contributions: thermally activated ionic conduction from the YSZ and fluctuation-assisted tunneling within the SWCNT network.

During the ablation of CGO, significant numbers of molecular ions of Ce-O+ and Gd-O+ were observed in the plume, even in vacuum, The presence of these species suggests that the background gas pressure required, during deposition, to maintain stoichiometry is required to enhance the sticking coefficient of Cef on the surface.

abstract = {Nanosilver is currently one of the most common engineered nanomaterials and is used in many applications that lead to the release of silver nanoparticles and silver ions into aqueous systems. Nanosilver also possesses enhanced antimicrobial activity and bioavailability that may less environmental risk compared with other manufactured nanomaterials. Described in this research are the synthesis of silver nanoparticle produced by chemical reduction from silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution. As a reducing agent, Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4) was used and mercaptosuccinic Acid (MSA) as stabilizer to prevent the nanoparticle from aglomerating. It was also used two kinds of solvent, they are water and methanol. In typical experiment MSA was dissolve in methanol with a number of variation of molarity i.e. 0,03 M, 0,06 M, 0,12 M, 0,15 M, and the mixture was kept under vigorous stirring in an ice bath. A solution of silver nitrate of 340 mg in 6,792 ml water was added. A freshly prepared aqueous solution of sodium borohydride (756,6 mL in 100 mL of water) was added drop wisely. The solution was kept for half an hour for stirring and were allowed to settle down in methanol. The obtained samples then characterized by means of x-ray diffractometer, and scanning electron microscopy, as well as transmission electron microscopy to obtain their structures of silver nanoparticles, morphology, and sizes. It is shown that diameter of silver nanoparticle sized about 24.3 nm (Ag@MSA 0.03 M), 20.4 nm (Ag@MSA 0.06 M), 16.8 nm (Ag@MSA 0.12 M), 16.9 nm (Ag@MSA 0.15 M) which was calculated by Scherrer formula by taking the FWHM from fitting to Gaussian. The phases and lattice parameter showed that there is no significant change in its volume by increasing molarity of stabilizer. In contrast, the size of particles is decreasing. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Structural and chemical heterogeneities can develop during synthesis, device fabrication, or service, which can profoundly affect proton transport. Here, we use time-resolved Kelvin probe force microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, atom probe tomography, and density functional theory calculations to intentionally introduce Ba-deficient planar and spherical defects and link the resultant atomic structure with proton transport behavior in both stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric epitaxial, yttrium-doped barium zirconate thin films. The defects were intentionally induced through high-temperature annealing treat-ment, while maintaining the epitaxial single crystalline structure of the films, with an overall relaxation in the atomic structure. The annealed samples showed smaller magnitudes of local lattice distortions because of the formation of proton polarons, thereby leading to decreased proton-trapping effect. This resulted in a decrease in the activation energy for proton transport, leading to faster proton transport.},

The open circuit voltage of 1.049 V at 600 ??C and 1.032 V at 700 ??C were achieved, indicating negligible gas permeation through the BCSO thin films. Maximum power densities of 132 and 340 mW/cm2 were obtained at 600 and 700 ??C, respectively. The impedance measurements at open circuit conditions showed that there were two rate-limiting processes for the electrode reactions and that the cell performances were essentially determined by the electrode polarization resistances at temperature below 650 ??C, which implied that it was essential to reduce the electrode polarization by developing novel electrode materials to improve the performance of ITSOFC based on BCSO electrolyte.

Samples deposited at temperatures below 700 degrees C are amorphous, with granular aspect, and with decreasing roughness with the temperature. Meanwhile, the films at 700 degrees C are polycrystalline and exhibit a needle-shaped surface, with the highest roughness observed.

For all cubic perovskites the concentration of protonic defects almost reaches the acceptor dopant concentration under appropriate conditions, and the mobility of protonic defects fall into a narrow range. Any symmetry reduction, however, leads to a reduction of the concentration and mobility of protonic defects. For all oxides, dynamical hydrogen bonding is suggested to lead to a local lattice softening, which provides an advantageous environment for high proton-mobility. This effect may explain the very high proton conductivity in covalent acceptor-doped BaZrO3, which has been found experimentally for the first time. Since this oxide also shows good thermodynamic phase stability, it is an interesting candidate as separator material in high-drain electrochemical applications such as fuel-cells.},

Similar comparisons are made for four-circle diffractometer measurements on ruby ([alpha]-Al2O3, with 0.46 wt % Cr in solid solution). The precisions are some parts in 105. There is partial support for the Taylor-Kennard [Acta Cryst. (1986), B42, 112-120] dictum that standard uncertainties (s.u.s) of cell parameters from routine four-circle diffractometer measurements are less than those for many-site measurements by factors of 5 for cell lengths and 2.5 for cell angles. For organic crystals, independent repetitions of adequate quality for comparison and analysis of routine four-circle diffractometer measurements are available only for [alpha]-oxalic acid dihydrate and anthracene. The experimental standard uncertainties given for these two crystals agree reasonably well with the sample s.u.s at room temperature, but appreciably less well at $\sim$100 K, again giving partial support to the Taylor-Kennard dictum. The relation between specimen characteristics and attainable precision is emphasized; the precisions for routine measurements on good quality organic crystals are some parts in 104. Area-detector measurements of cell dimensions have also been appraised; currently published s.u.s from such measurements appear to be highly unreliable, and this is supported by a recent analysis of the operation of such diffractometers [Paciorek et al. (1999). Acta Cryst. A55, 543-557]. Formulation of a standard protocol for such measurements is badly needed. The dangers inherent in high degrees of replication are illustrated by recounting Kapteyn's Parable of the Chinese Emperor. Attention is drawn to the fact that there has been little improvement in claimed precisions over the past 40-60 years.},

However, before fuel-cell technology can gain a significant share of the electrical power market, important issues have to be addressed. These issues include optimal choice of fuel, and the development of alternative materials in the fuel-cell stack. Present fuel-cell prototypes often use materials selected more than 25 years ago. Commercialization aspects, including cost and durability, have revealed inadequacies in some of these materials. Here we summarize recent progress in the search and development of innovative alternative materials.},

abstract = {Solid state sintering has been used to prepare the cubic perovskite structured compounds BaZr1-xInxO3-$\delta$ (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 0.75). Analysis of X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data reveals that the unit cell parameter, a, increases linearly with an increased Indium concentration. XRPD data was also used to demonstrate the completion of sample hydration, which was reached when the materials showed a set of single-phase Bragg-peaks. Dynamic thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data showed that approx. 89% of the total number of available oxygen vacancies can be filled in BaZr1-xInxO3-$\delta$ for x = 0.50, and that the maximum water uptake occurs below 300 °C. Rietveld analysis of the room temperature neutron powder diffraction (NPD) data confirmed the average cubic symmetry (space group Pm-3m), and an expansion of the unit cell parameter after the hydration reaction. The strong O-H stretch band, 2500-3500 cm- 1, in the infrared absorbance spectrum clearly manifests the presence of protons in the hydrated material. Proton conductivity of hydrated BaZr1-xInxO3-$\delta$, x = 0.75 was investigated during heating and cooling cycles under dry argon atmosphere. The total conductivity during the heating cycle was nearly two orders of magnitude greater than that of cooling cycle at 300 °C, whilst these values were similar at higher temperatures i.e. T > 600 °C. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

abstract = {Texture analysis is one of the fundamental aspects of human vision by which we discriminate between surfaces and objects. In a similar manner, computer vision can take advantage of the cues provided by surface texture to distinguish and recognize objects. In computer vision, texture analysis may be used alone or in combination with other sensed features (e.g. color, shape, or motion) to perform the task of recognition. Either way, it is a feature of paramount importance and boasts a tremendous body of work in terms of both research and applications. Currently, the main approaches to texture analysis must be sought out through a variety of research papers. This collection of chapters brings together in one handy volume the major topics of importance, and categorizes the various techniques into comprehensible concepts. The methods covered will not only be relevant to those working in computer vision, but will also be of benefit to the computer graphics, psychophysics, and pattern recognition communities, academic or industrial.},

We report the fabrication of BaZr(0.8)Y(0.2)O(3-$\delta$) (BZY) proton-conducting electrolyte thin films by pulsed laser deposition on different single-crystalline substrates. Highly textured, epitaxially oriented BZY films were obtained on (100)-oriented MgO substrates, showing the largest proton conductivity ever reported for BZY samples, being 0.11 S cm(-1) at 500 °C. The excellent crystalline quality of BZY films allowed for the first time the experimental measurement of the large BZY bulk conductivity above 300 °C, expected in the absence of blocking grain boundaries. The measured proton conductivity is also significantly larger than the conductivity values of oxygen-ion conductors in the same temperature range, opening new potential for the development of miniaturized SOFCs for portable power supply.},

In contrast, research on new electrolyte materials has shown a diverse range of structure-types, with an apparent tendency toward structures containing cations in lower coordination environments, particularly tetrahedral. In both the electrode and electrolyte area, materials allowing the incorporation of oxygen excess into interstitial sites have shown promising results, warranting further investigations of materials that will allow this type of defect chemistry.},

abstract = {Many metal oxides of fluorite and perovskite related structures are oxide ion conductors, which have practical applications in devices such as oxygen sensors, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and electrolysers. Several structural and thermodynamic parameters such as (1) critical radius of the pathway for the oxide ion movement, (2) free lattice volume, and (3) average metal-oxide bond energy have been proposed as predictors of high oxide ion conductivity. We discuss how these parameters all depend on ionic radii, and therefore, some of these may be redundant. Furthermore, we explore the interrelations among such parameters for fluorite and perovskite oxides by considering their sensitivities to the individual ionic radii. Based on experimental data available in the literature, it is argued that lattice distortion (lattice stress and deviation from cubic symmetry) due to ion radii mismatch determines the ionic conductivity to a very large extent, and that lattice distortion is of much greater importance than many other proposed parameters. In case of the perovskites, the charge of the B-site ion is also of major importance. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

The activation enthalpy of electrical conductivity, $\Delta$HDC, rises from 1.05 to 1.5 eV, with increasing Y2O3 content, pointing to growing association effects. In dielectric loss experiments, slightly higher activation enthalpies were found. In internal friction experiments, localized jumps of vacancies bound to yttrium ions can be observed as Debye loss peaks. Here, the activation enthalpy $\Delta$HML rises with increasing Y2O3 content from 0.9 to 1.6 eV.

However, thin-film growth by sputter deposition, which required the development of vacuum pumps and electrical power in the 1600s and the 1700s, is a much more recent phenomenon. First reported in the early 1800s, sputter deposition already dominated the optical-coating market by 1880. Preferential sputtering of alloys, sputtering of liquids, multitarget sputtering, and optical spectroscopy for process characterization were all described in the 1800s. Measurements of threshold energies and yields were carried out in the late 1800s, and yields in reasonable agreement with modern data were reported in the 1930s. Roll-to-roll sputter coating on flexible substrates was introduced in the mid-1930s, and the initial demonstration of sustained self-sputtering (i.e., sputtering without gas) was performed in 1970.

abstract = {Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have received much recent attention as next generation alternative energy sources. In particular, current efforts are devoted to reducing SOFC costs by downsizing fuel cell systems and lowering the operating temperature. Single-chamber SOFCs (SC-SOFCs) have the potential of meeting the demands. This type of fuel cell consists of only one gas chamber, wherein the anode and cathode are exposed to the same mixture of fuel and oxidant gas. This simplified design offers the possibility of reducing stack components and eliminating the need for sealing. Furthermore, since the principle of operation in the mixture is based on exothermic partial oxidation of the fuel that evolves a large amount of reaction heat, the cell temperature can be efficiently increased, enhancing the ion conductivity of the electrolyte and the catalytic activity of the electrodes. This paper reviews the current status of SC-SOFCs with principal emphasis on the materials aspect. In addition, the benefits and limitations of SC-SOFCs are discussed based on the cell design, performance, and energy efficiency.},

abstract = {Diffusion is a vital topic in solid-state physics and chemistry, physical\nmetallurgy and materials science. Diffusion processes are ubiquitous\nin solids at elevated temperatures. A thorough understanding of diffusion\nin materials is crucial for materials development and engineering.\nThis book first gives an account of the central aspects of diffusion\nin solids, for which the necessary background is a course in solid\nstate physics. It then provides easy access to important information\nabout diffusion in metals, alloys, semiconductors, ion-conducting\nmaterials, glasses and nanomaterials. Several diffusion-controlled\nphenomena, including ionic conduction, grain-boundary and dislocation\npipe diffusion, are considered as well.Graduate students in solid-state\nphysics, physical metallurgy, materials science, physical and inorganic\nchemistry or geophysics will benefit from this book as will physicists,\nchemists, metallurgists, materials engineers in academic and industrial\nresearch laboratories.},

abstract = {Transition metal doped II-VI semiconductor materials features excellent spectroscopic and lasing characteristics in the middle infrared (mid-IR). Among this class of laser material, the most impressive results have been obtained from chromium-doped zinc selenide (Cr2+:ZnSe) crystals. To date, Cr2+:ZnSe materials are arguably the best choice of laser gain material for the advancements of high power mid-IR lasers broadly tunable over the 2-3 µm spectral range. The dissertation objectives are to demonstrate technological advancements in the development Cr2+:ZnSe thin films by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) thus establishing a viable route for the synthesis of mid-IR laser gain media based on Cr2+:ZnSe thin films. The first major objective of this dissertation is the realization of high opticalquality Cr2+:ZnSe thin films with effective control over the Cr2+ dopant concentration and uniformity. Accomplishing this objective could only be attained through the availability of high quality Cr-doped ZnSe ablation targets. Manufacturing procedures for ablation targets fabricated in-house were perfected and used to produce Cr2+ concentration variations in films deposited to less than 15\% in samples with Cr2+ concentration $\sim$1019 ions/cm3. PLD deposition parameters were optimized that resulted in formation of high optical quality Cr2+:ZnSe films that were used to consistently exhibit room temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements over the 2-3 µm mid-IR spectral range. This was the first demonstration of PL measurements from PLD grown Cr2+:ZnSe thin films. The second objective was to demonstrate mid-IR lasing from PLD grown Cr2+:ZnSe based thin film structures. The first demonstration of 2.63 µm mid-IR lasing in a Cr2+:ZnSe thin film planar waveguide structure developed using PLD is presented in this dissertation research. Mid-IR lasing oscillation within a planar waveguide, achieved through the deposition of a highly doped Cr2+:ZnSe film on sapphire substrate, was obtained at room temperature under gain-switched optical excitation. Highly doped Cr2+:ZnSe thin films were also used to demonstrate passive Q-switching of Er-doped YAG laser operating at 1.645 µm. The third objective was to develop Cr2+:ZnSe-based thin film electroluminescent structures by PLD. Significant progress was made in the development of thin film structure designs that shows promising results for the impending successful demonstration of mid-IR electroluminescence.},

abstract = {This paper reports impedance studies of the cathode/electrolyte behaviour in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), based on comparative investigation of half-cells with yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte and different cathode materials: lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM), and composite LSM/YSZ with low ionic conductivity as well as the electron conducting Ag, Pt and Au. For improved impedance data analysis the technique of the differential impedance analysis is applied. It ensures structural and parametric identification without preliminary assumptions about the working model. It is found that despite the low ionic conductivity of LSM, the cathode reaction of the oxide cathode materials is a two-step process including: (i) charge transfer with activation energy of the resistivity Ea increasing with the temperature and (ii) transport of oxygen ions through the bulk of the electrode (rate-limiting stage) with Ea independent on the temperature. For the metal (electron conducting) electrodes, the reaction behaviour is described with one step process with higher Ea at higher temperatures. The activation energy of the electrolyte conductivity decreases with the increase of the temperature. The observed changes in Ea for the electrolyte and the cathode reaction (the charge transfer step for the LSM-based electrodes) appear in the same temperature interval. This interesting coincidence suggests for correlation between the bulk (electrolyte) and surface conduction properties. Approaches for improvement of both the ionic conductivity and the supply with electrons in LSM should be also searched.},

abstract = {Anode supported (Ni/YSZ–YSZ–LSM/YSZ) solid oxide fuel cells were tested and the degradation over time was monitored and analyzed by impedance spectroscopy. Test conditions were chosen to focus on the anode degradation and all tests were operated at 750°C. O2 was supplied to the cathode and the anode inlet gas mixture had a high p(H2O)/p(H2) ratio of 0.4/0.6. Commercially available gasses were applied. Cells were tested over a few hundred hours applying varying current densities (OCV, 0.75A/cm2 and 1A/cm2). To investigate the effects of possible impurities in the inlet gas stream on the anode degradation, tests were set-up both with and without gas cleaning. Gas cleaning was done by passing the H2 over porous nickel at room temperature. It was found that cleaning of the inlet H2 gas more than halved the anode degradation under current load. For tests at OCV the increase in the Ni–YSZ charge transfer reaction resistance changed from ∼0.10$\Omega$cm2 to become negligible (below 0.002$\Omega$cm2) upon applying H2 gas cleaning over the couple of hundred of hours of testing. Both for tests with and without H2 gas cleaning applied, it was surprisingly found that operating the solid oxide fuel cells at OCV prior to fuel cell testing provided fuel cell tests with minimal/negligible anode degradation compared to tests where fuel cell testing was started immediately after initial characterization of the cells.},

The cell reaches power densities of 0.5 W cm(-2) at 550 degrees C and 0.9 W cm(-2) at 600 degrees C, with open circuit voltage (OCV) values larger than 1.04 V The bi-layer electrolyte contains a 6-7 mu m, thick sarnarium-doped ceria (SDC) layer deposited over a similar to 1 mu m thick scandium-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) layer. The electrical leaking between the anode and cathode through the SDC electrolyte, which due to the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ in reducing environment when using a single layer SDC electrolyte, has been eliminated by adopting the bi-layer electrolyte concept. Both ScSZ and SDC layers in the bi-layer electrolyte prepared by the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique are the highly conductive cubic phases. Poor conductive (Zr, Ce)O-2-based solid solutions or P-phase ScSZ were not found in the bi-layer electrolyte prepared by the PLD due to low processing temperatures of the technique. Excellent reliability and flexibility of the PLD technique makes it a very promising technique for the fabrication of thin electrolyte layer for SOFCs operating at reduced temperatures.

The BaZrO3 specimens exhibited a thermal expansion coefficient of about one half, and elastic moduli more than twice, those of polycrystalline high-temperature superconductors. Diffusional creep was observed when BaZrO3 was compressed at 1300–1400°C; the activation energy for steady-state deformation was 460±30 kJ/mole. The mechanism was probably grain-boundary sliding, controlled by diffusion of one of the cations along grain boundaries. Deformation rates below 1000°C were too low to relax thermally generated stresses.},

In agreement with recent EXAFS studies, small lanthanide dopants are predicted to substitute on the Zr-site (with oxygen vacancy compensation necessary for proton incorporation), while larger lanthanide dopants substitute on the A-site. Proton incorporation in AZrO3is found to be exothermic, with increasing acceptor dopant levels causing an energetic stabilisation of the protonic defect. Our results suggest that trends in proton conductivity can be rationalised in terms of effective oxygen vacancy creation arising from dopant site selectivity, relative values of water incorporation energies, and possible proton-dopant association.},

Nanometric NiO particles dispersed over the yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were prepared, resulting in dense sintered specimens with no solid solution formation between the oxides. Such a feature allowed for the electrical characterization of the composites in a wide range of relative volume fraction, temperature, and oxygen partial pressure. The main results indicate that the composites have high electrical conductivity, and the transport properties in these mixed ionic-electronic (MIEC) composites are strongly dependent on the relative volume fraction of the phases, microstructure, and temperature. These parameters should hence be taken into consideration for the optimized design of MIEC composites for electrochemical applications. In this context, the composite was reduced under H-2 for the preparation of high-conductivity YSZ/Ni cermets for use as solid oxide fuel cell anode material with relatively low metal content.

The temperature dependence of the activation energy of electrical conductivity is connected with the different impurity states in the oxide layers. With respect to the lowest density of defects assessed from deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements, the CeO2/Si interface seems to be an optimum compared to the other oxide layer configurations.},

The spectra of the dry sample evidence two 5D0→7F0 bands clearly indicating that Eu3+ (replacing Y3+ in the Zr4+ position of the average cubic perovskite structure) occupies two different local structures, whilst only one Eu3+ site is observed for the hydrated material. From the spectral data, it is possible to identify the nature of these two sites and to propose point group symmetries for the average local geometry around Eu3+. The decay time of the 5D0 level becomes shorter upon hydration, due to the interaction with high-frequency O–H stretching vibrations, indicating an attractive interaction between protons and dopant atoms.},

abstract = {Ceramic samples of Ce1-xPrxO2-delta (CPO) and Ce1-xGdxO2-delta (CGO) were obtained by different sintering schedules, including the use of cobalt as a sintering aid, added by mixing the precursor powders with cobalt nitrate solution; this allowed one to obtain different microstructural features and to change the transport properties, with emphasis on changes in grain boundary behaviour. Cobalt plays a double effect as sintering aid and also to induce important changes of grain boundary properties. Specific changes of grain boundary properties were ascribed by de-convolution of impedance spectra. Relatively high levels of mixed conductivity could be attained by adding a lanthanide species to yield ionic transport, whereas electronic conduction was promoted by the mixed valence character of PrOx, combined with the additional contribution of Co-rich grain boundaries. These effects can be used to tune preferential electronic conductivity at bulk or grain boundary level. Oxygen permeability and a modified e.m.f. method were used to obtain the overall ionic transport number under oxidising conditions and its dependence on processing conditions. Additions of PrOx induce bulk electronic conduction which assumes a greater role at lower temperatures. Further enhancement of electronic conductivity is attained by effects of Co-addition. Though Co-rich grain boundaries also yield significant levels of electronic conductivity in CGO. this contribution becomes minor at intermediate temperatures, due to differences between the activation energies for electronic and ionic conduction.

Opportunities for reduced temperature operation and portable power generation arise from the decreased thickness of the solid electrolyte, as well at the metastable phases and nanoscale-dependent effects that are a consequence of the reduced temperature of fabrication. Challenges such as enhanced cation diffusion along grain boundaries are; however, also observed, potentially impacting the long-term stability of these devices. Recent progress achieved in understanding these and other challenges are reviewed and directions for future work identified.},

abstract = {Glass-based microchannel chips were fabricated using photolithographic technology, and Pt thin-film microelectrodes, as coplanar impedance sensors, were integrated on them. Longitudinal design parameters, such as interelectrode spacing and electrode width, of coplanar impedance sensors were changed to determine AC frequency characteristics as design parameters. Through developing total impedance equations and modeling equivalent circuits, the dominant components in each frequency region were illustrated for coplanar impedance sensors and the measured results were compared with fitted values. As the ionic concentration increased, the value of the frequency-independent region decreased and cut-off frequencies increased. As the interelectrode spacing increased, cut-off frequencies decreased and total impedance increased. However, the width of each frequency-independent region was similar. As the electrode area increased, f(low) decreased but f(high) was fixed. We think that the decrease in R(Sol) dominated over the influence of other components, which resulted in heightening f(low) and f(high). The interelectrode spacing is a more significant parameter than the electrode area in the frequency characteristics of coplanar sensors. The deviation of experimentally obtained results from theoretically predicted values may result from the fringing effect of coplanar electrode structure and parasitic capacitance due to dielectric substrates. We suggest the guidelines of dominant components for sensing as design parameters.},

The films have been deposited under oxygen atmospheres on porous NiO/YSZ substrates heated from room temperature to 600 °. YSZ films were obtained in the range of 1-2 $\mu$m thickness. The films have been investigated with respect to surface morphology, microstructure and film-substrate interface interaction. The film morphology varied from columnar to an irregular crystalline structure depending on the oxygen pressure and the substrate temperature. In all cases the films consisted of YSZ with the cubic fluorite structure. The formation of oxide layers under low oxygen pressures on the NiO/YSZ substrates is due to a film-substrate redox interaction. The NiO gains close to the coating interface are partially reduced and serve as an oxygen source for the oxidation of the film. The measured. He leakage rates to analyze the gas tightness of the YSZ films have so far shown no improvements as compared with uncoated substrates. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Stoichiometric composition of LSGM film was successfully prepared by optimizing the deposition parameters and the target composition. When Sm0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta (SSC) was used as cathode material, extremely high power density was achieved at relatively low temperature. The maximum power density reached to 3270, 1951, 612 and 80 mW/cm(2) at 973, 873, 773 and 673 K, respectively. Detail analysis by current interruption method revealed that IR drop was still dominant internal resistance at low temperature and the overpotential of the anode and the cathode was not significant even at 673 K.

Even when the GDC-side is exposed to reducing atmosphere, the electronic conductivity is also suppressed, but to a less extent. It is suggested that oxygen activity distribution is discontinuous across the YSZ/GDC interface under ion-blocking condition, refuting the "continuity hypothesis" that has been usually adopted in calculating the oxygen activity distribution across a multilayer of mixed conductor oxides.

abstract = {A defect chemistry model is proposed for the brownmillerite oxides with high oxygen ion conductivity. Ba2In2O5 was chosen as the model material and its electrical conductivity and transport properties have been studied in detail. The oxygen ion conduction above the order-disorder temperature, Td ≈ 925 °C, and the mixed ionic-electronic conduction below Td, was studied by conductivity and EMF measurements as a function of temperature and oxygen activity. The main defects are intrinsic anion Frenkel defects below Td, and above Td the oxide can be treated as acceptor-doped perovskite with extrinsic oxygen vacancies. Charge compensation involves only ionic defects over the whole PO2 range used in this study. The formation and mobility enthalpies of the Frenkel defects, the redox enthalpies, and the band gap have been obtained for this oxide. The proposed model is in good agreement with the experimental results. Decomposition of Ba2In2O5 with reduction of In3+ is indicated by the conductivity measurements. Degradation in CO2 atmospheres with formation of BaCO3 and volatilization of In2O3 was also observed by XRD and EDS techniques. It is clear that In3+ will have to be replaced by an element with a more stable 3 + oxidation state (e.g. Y, Er, Ga), if a brownmillerite compound is to be a useful solid electrolyte over a wide range of oxygen activities.},

abstract = {Oxide groups consisting of two or more different cations are called complex or mixed oxides, and many types of structures are known that are different from those of the simple oxides. In some special cases, oxides consisting of a single cation in different oxidation states are also classified as mixed oxides. For example, Eu 3 O 4 , a mixed oxide, consists of Eu(III) and Eu(II) in 6- or 8-coordination, respectively. However, the most typical structure of a mixed oxide consists simply of two or more different cations with different oxidation states, ionic radii, and coordination numbers. This diversity, which comes from the complexity of these structures, results in a larger number of different properties as compared to those of simple oxides. One of the most well known and important complex oxide structures is the spinel structure (AB 2 O 4 ), which shows important magnetic properties.},

abstract = {Barium zirconate has attracted particular attention among candidate proton conducting electrolyte materials for fuel cells and other electrochemical applications because of its chemical stability, mechanical robustness, and high bulk proton conductivity. Development of electrochemical devices based on this material, however, has been hampered by the high resistance of grain boundaries, and, due to limited grain growth during sintering, the high number density of such boundaries. Here, we demonstrate a fabrication protocol based on the sol - gel synthesis of nanocrystalline precursor materials and reactive sintering that results in large-grained, polycrystalline BaZr 0.8Y 0.2C 3-$\delta$ of total high conductivity, ∼ 1 × 10 -2 Scm -1 at 450 °C. The detrimental role of grain boundaries in these materials is confirmed via a comparison of the conductivities of polycrystalline samples with different grain sizes. Specifically, two samples with grain sizes differing by a factor of 2.3 display essentially identical grain interior conductivities, whereas the total grain boundary conductivities differ by a factor of 2.5-3.2, depending on the temperature (with the larger-grained material displaying higher conductivity). {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

Pure, high crystal quality epitaxial films of BZY are obtained on MgO and on perovskite-type substrates, despite the large lattice mismatch. The deposition conditions influence the morphology, cell parameters and chemical composition of the film, the oxygen partial pressure during film growth being the most determining. Film characterization was carried out using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron and atomic force microscopies, wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. All films show a slight tetragonal distortion that is not directly related to the substrate-induced strain. The proton conductivity of the films depends on deposition conditions and film thickness, and for the optimised conditions its total conductivity is slightly higher than the bulk conductivity of the target material (3 mS/cm at 600 °C, in wet 5% H2/Ar). The conductivities are, however, more than one order of magnitude lower than the highest reported in literature and possible reasoning is elucidated in terms of local and extended defects in the films.},

abstract = {Y-doped BaZrO3 (BZY) is a promising candidate as an electrolyte in fuel cells, and attracts increasing attention. In this work, a systematic investigation was performed on microstructure, proton concentration, proton conductivity, and hydration induced chemical expansion in Y-doped BaZrO3. The results revealed that the bimodal microstructure in BaZr0.85Y0.15O3−$\delta$ was composed of large grains with composition close to the nominal value, and fine grains with large compositional discrepancy. This property is considered to be one of the evidences of phase separation at lower temperature than sintering temperature (1600°C), which hinders the grain growth. Thermal expansion coefficient of BZY was measured for various dopant level, and was determined to be around 10−5 K−1 in wet and dry argon atmosphere. In addition, chemical expansion effect due to hydration was confirmed by HT-XRD in dry and wet Ar atmospheres, and suggests an interesting relationship between the lattice change ratio and proton concentration, in the BZY system with different Y content. The change ratio of lattice constant due to hydration increased obviously with the proton concentration for the sample containing the Y content of 0.02 and 0.05, but only changed slightly when the Y content was increased to 0.1 and 0.15. However, when the Y content was further increased over 0.2, the change ratio of lattice constant due to hydration starts to increase obviously again. Such results indicate a high possibility that the stable sites of protons in BZY changed with the variation in Y content.},

abstract = {Electrical conduction in the solid proton electrolyte based on SrCeO3 was studied under water-containing atmospheres at high temperatures. The change of conductivity was measured systematically as a function of the concentration of the dopant or of the partial pressures of water vapor and oxygen. Since the conduction in the oxides was not purely protonic but partially electronic, these conductivities were determined separately using a steam concentration cell. It was observed that the proton conductivity increased in proportion to P12H2O and was independent of PO2. It was also recognized that the electronic conduction present in the oxides was due to holes and the hole conductivity followed the P14O2 law. A possible model for the proton formation in the oxides is discussed and it is proposed that the protons might be produced from water vapor at the expense of holes.},

The kinetic energy of the species in the laser-generated plasma, as measured by time-of-flight optical emission spec- troscopy and time-of-flight quadrupole mass spectrometry, is described as a function of the pressure of the processing gas, the distance from the target, and the laser fluence.

X-ray diffraction measurements and polarisation-depen- dent micro-Raman measurements reveal a c-axis orientation normal to the substrate surface, in the case of high particle energy (> 50 eV), whereas at low kinetic energies (< 30 eV) a [111]pc or [110]pc orientation is preferred. The ferroelec- tricity and the dielectric constant of the films, determined by impedance measurements, decrease with increasing kinetic energy of the film-forming particles from $\epsilon$r = 1000–2200 to $\epsilon$r = 200–700. This decrease correlates with the change of the orientation and with an increasing lattice constant of the films, indicating that particles with high kinetic energies pro- duce crystal defects and stress in the growing film.},

The detailed features of the crystal structure, both short-range and long-range, as well as the crystal chemistry driving the doping process, are largely unknown.We use very high resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD) to resolve the crystal structure,which is very slightly tetragonally distorted in BZY, while the local environment around Zr4þ and Y3þ is probed with extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and the symmetry and vibrations are investigated by using Raman spectroscopy. It is found that bariumzirconate shows some degree of local deviation from the cubic arystotype even if undoped, which upon substitution by the perceptibly larger Y3þ, playing the role of a rigid inclusion, is further increased. This distortion is one limiting factor concerning the Y3þ solubility. The effects are correlated to the proton conduction properties of BZY. KEYWORDS:},

These results showed that the decomposition of the precursors occurs in a two-step reaction and temperatures higher that 1000 degreesC are required for these decomposition reactions.

The morphology of the deposited perovskite thick films (similar to50 mum) was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy and showed a porous microstructure. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out under synthetic air flux at temperatures ranging from 200-600degreesC in the 10 mHz-10 MHz frequency range showing an interfacial electrical resistance related to the La0.8Sr0.2Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta electrodes. EIS measurements were also performed in the same frequency range at different oxygen partial pressures (10(-5)- 1 atm) at 600 degreesC. At this temperature and frequencies below 0.1 MHz, the electrical response to the applied signal of the electrode material is best fitted by two semicircles, which can be related to charge-transfer processes. The activation energy for the limiting step (adsorption/desorption) was found to be 1.6 eV. (C) 2004 The Electrochemical Society.},

The local structure around the cations was studied by X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the K-edges of Ba, Ce and Y. It is demonstrated that the insertion of yttrium in the site of cerium produces a remarkable local distortion of the dopant first-shell octahedral environment that affects also the next coordination shells by a static disorder increasing with dopant amount. For a dopant concentration estimated as x > 0.17, a poorly crystallized yttrium oxide phase that cannot be detected by X-ray diffraction is segregated. The static disorder around Y noticeably increases in the protonated samples and can be related to a preferential location of protons near the dopant.},

Membranes mechanically stable at operating temperatures as high as 700 degrees C were obtained for deposition temperatures in the range between 400 and 700 degrees C. Thermomechanical behavior as measured by X-ray microdiffraction was correlated with the evolution of the microstructure with the temperature from TEM analysis, comparing as-deposited and post-deposition annealed membranes. Electrical properties of both yttria-stabilized zirconia films and membranes were studied by DC conductivity and impedance spectroscopy, respectively. A difference of almost one order of magnitude was measured between bulk and stressed films while conductivities close to the bulk were observed for YSZ membranes.

abstract = {In this report the ionic conductivity of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is researched. YSZ transports oxygen through its lattice and can, for example, be used for the detection of oxygen and, indirectly, for harmful NOx gasses that contribute to environmental problems. The objective of this research was to determine the influence of the crystal structure on the ionic conductivity of YSZ thin films produced by pulsed laser deposition. The materials used for the electrodes and wiring of the samples, the measurement set-up and the sample configuration played an important role in obtaining successful impedance measurements in temperatures up to 900{\textordmasculine}C. Part of this research was therefore contributed to finding the optimal conditions for ionic conductivity measurements on YSZ thin films. Four electrode materials were chosen and tested, knowing SrRuO3, Pt, Au and Pt-paste, but only SrRuO3 and Pt were useful until 700{\textordmasculine}C. After that temperature the films started to segregate, which reduced the electrode contact area and increased the resistance. So none of the electrode materials was suitable to measure up to 900{\textordmasculine}C in an oxygen environment. However, the results obtained from low temperature measurements can be extrapolated to higher temperatures to get an indication of the values at high temperatures. For the wiring gold was used. YSZ thin films were deposited on SrTiO3 as well as on NdGaO3, resulting in different crystallinities. On NdGaO3, the YSZ was deposited epitaxial in the [00l] directions and on the SrTiO3 in the [011] and [00l] directions. The activation energy of YSZ was around 0.87 eV, which was lower than the literature values. The activation energies decreased to unrealistic values for ionic conduction at temperatures above 700{\textordmasculine}C. Here electronic contributions might have played a part. Also the ionic conductivities were at least one order of magnitude lower than expected, this was attributed to electrode segregation. The YSZ film on STO had the highest conductivity throughout the whole temperature range, which can be caused by the difference in crystallinity. Though before drawing hard conclusions the measurements should be repeated. So at this moment, no clear answer can be given on the question how the crystal structure of YSZ influences the ionic conductivity.},

abstract = {Barium cerate has a high proton conductivity but rather poor chemical stability in CO2-containing atmospheres. Barium zirconate, in contrast, is a rather stable material but one that exhibits low proton conductivity. In the present work, the conductivity and chemical stability of solid solutions between these compounds have been investigated, in an attempt to find a composition exhibiting both high conductivity and good stability. Compounds of general formula BaCe0.9−xZrxM0.1O3−$\delta$, where M was Gd or Nd and x ranged from 0 to 0.4, were prepared by solid state reaction and characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) in flowing CO2, differential thermal analysis (DTA) in flowing CO2, and AC impedance spectroscopy in dry and H2O-saturated argon. Introduction of Zr into doped barium cerate greatly enhanced the chemical stability: for the Nd-doped system, compositions with x=0.2 or higher did not react with CO2 (under the experimental, non-equilibrium conditions), whereas for the Gd-doped system, the composition with x=0.4 did not react. Not unexpectedly, introduction of Zr also led to a decrease in conductivity and an increase in the activation energy for proton transport. Overall, Nd-doped samples exhibited higher chemical stability and lower conductivity than those doped with Gd. The composition BaCe0.7Zr0.2Nd0.1O3−$\delta$ appears to give a good compromise between conductivity and stability for fuel cell applications.},

abstract = {The chapter presents a study on relations between the concentrations of imperfections in crystalline solids. Many properties of crystalline solids, such as the electronic or ionic conductivity, the color, the luminescence, and the magnetic susceptibility are determined by the presence of imperfections. Generally, six types of primary imperfections are distinguished; namely phonons, electrons and holes, excitons, vacant lattice sites and interstitial atoms or ions, foreign atoms or ions in either interstitial or substitutional positions, and dislocations. In addition atoms of the base crystal may be present at lattice sites normally occupied by other atoms. Five types of primary imperfections—namely, electrons and holes, vacant lattice sites, interstitials, misplaced lattice atoms, and foreign atoms—are discussed in this chapter. The chapter presents a new treatment of these problems by making use of a graphical representation. This treatment, together with the use of a band scheme for the electronic energy levels, greatly facilitates the application of the theory and the deduction of conclusions from it. Apart from a few exceptions, binary nonmetallic compounds of the formula M X will be considered almost exclusively. Here M indicates an element of a more electropositive character (metal) and X an element of a more electronegative character.},

abstract = {Highly textured thin films with small grain boundary regions can be used as model systems to directly measure the bulk conductivity of oxygen ion conducting oxides. Ionic conducting thin films and epitaxial heterostructures are also widely used to probe the effect of strain on the oxygen ion migration in oxide materials. For the purpose of these investigations a good lattice matching between the film and the substrate is required to promote the ordered film growth. Moreover, the substrate should be a good electrical insulator at high temperature to allow a reliable electrical characterization of the deposited film. Here we report the fabrication of an epitaxial heterostructure made with a double buffer layer of BaZrO3 and SrTiO3 grown on MgO substrates that fulfills both requirements. Based on such template platform, highly ordered (001) epitaxially oriented thin films of 15% Sm-doped CeO2 and 8 mol% Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 are grown. Bulk conductivities as well as activation energies are measured for both materials, confirming the success of the approach. The reported insulating template platform promises potential application also for the electrical characterization of other novel electrolyte materials that still need a thorough understanding of their ionic conductivity.},

abstract = { The present contribution demonstrates that A-site acceptor doping of BaZrO 3 by alkali metals may significantly enhance its bulk proton conductivity compared to that of Y-doped BaZrO 3 .  In the present contribution, we assess the efficiency of the alkali metals (Na, K, Rb and Cs) as A-site acceptor dopants in proton conducting BaZrO 3 by first principles calculations. The calculated acceptor–proton complexes become weaker with increasing dopant size, with binding energies ranging from −0.33 eV for Na to −0.10 eV for Cs, which is in the range of, or even lower than, those found for B-site doped BaZrO 3 . By mapping out all relevant minimum energy pathways for the proton, we reveal that the highest migration energy barrier for most of the alkali metals is comparable or even lower than that of Y. Further, all A-site dopants display more exothermic hydration enthalpies compared to that of Y-doped BaZrO 3 , ranging from −131 kJ mol −1 to −83 kJ mol −1 for Na and Cs, respectively. The calculated dopant solubility increases in the order Na < Cs < Rb < K, with the predicted solubilities of the two latter being in the range of that of e.g. Y. Although Cs would lead to the highest proton mobility, the higher solubility of K and Rb renders them more attractive A-site dopants for BaZrO 3 . Overall, our results suggest that alkali metals as A-site dopants may enhance the bulk proton conductivity of BaZrO 3 , compared to Y-doped BaZrO 3 . },

abstract = {A critical review of the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) of amorphous diamond-like carbon (DLC) films is presented. A short review of the PLD process is followed by a review of various experimental configurations for DLC deposition and a discussion of the influence of process parameters on the composition and energy of ablated carbon plumes. Particular emphasis is given to the relationship between plume properties and film structure and mechanical characteristics. For the first time, a cumulative influence of the laser power density (fluence) and wavelength on the formation and properties of DLC films is shown. The influence of bias, additional auxiliary energy, substrate temperature, and the presence of hydrogen is also discussed. A fluence-wavelength region for DLC formation is proposed and correlated with the kinetic energy of ablated carbon species. It is shown that lower fluences are required to produce DLC films when shorter-wavelength lasers are used. The latest available results on applications of PLD DLC films as protective coatings for reducing friction and wear are also discussed. Methods are proposed to improve film adhesion to steel substrates, so that DLC films can be used in highly loaded friction contacts. Finally, process improvements that are necessary to permit scaling up PLD for growing DLC films are outlined.},

abstract = {Ultrathin BaZr 0.8 Ti 0.2 O 3 films (t  <  30 nm) on SiO x /Si substrates were obtained by means of aqueous chemical solution deposition (CSD). Though the precursor crystallized into cubic perovskite powder at 600°C, ultrathin films only crystallized at 950 to 1000°C, even after addition of excess Ba to compensate for loss of Ba. Films with thickness above 100 nm, on the other hand, crystallized readily around 650°C. The crystallization is related to film thickness, affecting the crystallization activation energy, and to silicate formation by reaction with the substrate, exerting its largest influence in ultrathin films. Barium deficiency, silicate formation, carbonate secondary phase and the high activation energy for crystallization resulted in the amorphous nature of the ultrathin films, which strongly affects the observed k value (∼ 15). The paper contributes insights with implications for the application of BaZr 0.8 Ti 0.2 O 3 as an alternative high-k gate dielectric. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

The microstructures of the obtained films are compared with existing structural zone models for thin-film growth. The model developed by Thornton (1974) for metallic sputtered films is applied to the metal oxide films grown by PLD and gives a good description for the growth process and the dependence of the microstructure on deposition temperature and pressure. A map of formed microstructures is compiled as a function of background pressure and substrate temperature, and the conditions to obtain dense or porous films for YSZ and CGO are established. The two materials show the same dependence on temperature and pressure. Higher background pressure yields more porous films and a fully dense structure cannot be achieved for substrate temperatures in the range from room temperature to 800 °C. Of special interest for us was the realization and characterization of dense films processed at low temperature (< 500 °C) for the preparation of free-standing membranes to be used in a micro solid oxide fuel cell. We could achieve such films by processing at 400 °C in 0.026 mbar of oxygen. In-plane electric conductivities of the films were measured and correlated with the microstructures.},

abstract = {Impedance spectroscopy (IS) is a general term that subsumes the small-signal mea- surement of the linear electrical response of a material of interest (including electrode effects) and the subsequent analysis of the response to yield useful information about the physicochemical properties of the system. Analysis is generally carried out in the frequency domain, although measurements are sometimes made in the time domain and then Fourier transformed to the frequency domain. IS is by no means limited to the measurement and analysis of data at the impedance level (e.g., impedance vs. fre- quency) but may involve any of the four basic immittance levels: thus, most gener- ally, IS stands for immittance spectroscopy.},

abstract = {Detailed X-ray and neutron powder diffraction structural studies are reported for the proton conducting perovskite system "La0.6Ba0.4ScO2.8". Both dry and wet samples were analysed, with the latter prepared by heating in N-2/H2O or N-2/D2O. Although X-ray diffraction suggested that a sample of this nominal composition was single phase, neutron diffraction showed small levels of SC2O3 impurity with the actual composition for the perovskite phase in the dry sample being La0.73Ba0.27ScO2.865. This can be related to Ba volatility at the high temperatures required for the synthesis of this phase, and the result raises important questions regarding many barium containing materials previously reported as single phase by X-ray diffraction. For the hydrated samples, data was collected at 4.2 K and a linked dual refinement for the protonated and deuterated samples was performed in order to provide an accurate location for the HID position, making use of the contrast provided by the fact that the nuclear scattering factor of His negative while that of D is positive. This unique dual refinement proved to be successful in locating the H/D despite the low occupancies present, with a final composition of La(0.73)Ba(0.27)ScO(2.865)0.135(H/D)20 and the H/D associated with the O1 position. The protons and deuteriums are associated with the O1 oxygen site, pointing towards the mixed LaBa position. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Nanophase hydroxyapatite (HA) is finding applications in many areas of biomedical research, including bone tissue engineering, drug delivery, and intracellular imaging. Details in chemical composition, crystal phase makeup, size, and shape of HA nanoparticles play important roles in achieving the favorable biological responses required in these applications. Most of the nanophase HA synthesis techniques involve solution-based methods that exhibit substantial aggregation of particles upon precipitation. Typically these methods also have limited control over the particle size and crystal phase composition. In this study, we describe the gas-phase synthesis of aggregation-free, size-controlled HA nanoparticles with mean size in the 20-70 nm range using laser ablation followed by aerosol electrical mobility classification. Nanoparticle deposits with adjustable number concentration were obtained on solid substrates. Particles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Samples are well represented by log-normal size distributions with geometric standard deviation $\sigma$ ≈ 1.2. The most suitable conditions for HA nanoparticle formation at a laser fluence of 5 J/cm were found to be a temperature of 800 °C and a partial pressure of water of 160 mbar. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

To verify the chemical stability, all the synthesized oxides were exposed to 100% CO2at 900 °C for 3 h and the phase composition of the resulting specimens was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The chemical stability against CO2increased with increasing the Zr content, with good results for samples with x ≥ 0.5. The electrical conductivity of the samples was investigated as a function of the Zr content using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Hydrogen-air fuel cell experiments were carried out at 700 °C using the BCZY proton conducting electrolytes and platinum electrodes. Promising performance was observed for BaCe0.3Zr0.5Y0.2O3 - $\delta$because it maintains the good chemical stability of barium zirconate but with improved electrical conductivity and fuel cell performance. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Oxide-ion conduction in oxygen-deficient perovskites is analogous in several respects to that in oxygen-deficient fluorite structures. We report here an important difference: oxygen-deficient AMO3-yperovskites containing M cations that are unstable in less than sixfold anion coordination may, at modest temperatures, capture oxygen and/or water from air to fill, at least partially, the oxygen vacancies. The insertion of water introduces mobile protons; the insertion of oxygen oxidizes the oxide-ion array in the presence of fully oxidized main group cations. We illustrate this insertion with the perovskite system BaZr1-xInxO3-0.5x, M=Zr or Hf. The data suggest that any ordering of the oxygen vacancies so as to give planes of corner-shared MO4tetrahedra permits facile insertion of water and/or oxygen. In contrast, the oxygen-deficient fluorite structure has each cation in at least sixfold oxide-ion coordination, and the problem of water or oxygen insertion at modest temperatures does not arise. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Proton transport properties across the grain boundary of barium zirconate based proton conductors were studied in accordance with the space charge concept. The analysis is performed at temperatures lower than 200°C using a Mott-Schottky model. The barrier height of Y- and Gd-doped barium zirconate is in the range of 0.29 to 0.57 V, which higher than that of oxygen ionic conductors. The barrier height of the space charge layer shows a dependence on the dopant type and concentration. The dependence correlates with the enrichment of the dopant at the grain boundary. The results suggest that the enrichment of the dopant decreases the barrier height and is effective to improve proton transport properties across the grain boundary. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {Rare earth (or yttriurn) doped BaCeO3 has been widely investigated as a proton conducting material. Usually, the trivalent dopants are assumed to occupy the Cell-site, which introduces oxygen vacancies into the perovskite structure and furthers the protonic conductivity. Recent studies indicate the possibility of dopant incorporation on the Ba2+-site, which is unfavorable for protonic conductivity. In this work atomistic simulation techniques, especially the supercell approach, have been developed to investigate the questions of dopant site-selectivity and cation nonstoichiometry in doped BaCeO3. Our calculations predict that, on eneractic grounds, Ba2+- C, site deficiency shifts trivalent dopant incorporation onto the Ba2(+)-site. These results confirm that the dopant partitioning or site-occupancy of trivalent dopants will be sensitive to the precise Ba/Ce ratio. and hence to the experimental processing conditions. The relative energies explain the experimentally observed "amphoteric" behavior of Nd with significant dopant partitioning over both Ba and Cc sites. Such partitioning reduces the concentration of oxygen vacancies, which, in turn, lowers proton uptake and decreases proton conductivity relative to dopant incorporation solely on the Ce4+-site.},

The phase purity and lattice parameters of the materials have been studied by the room temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been done for check the morphology and grain growth of the samples. The chemical and mechanical stabilities have been done using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in pure CO2environment and thermomechanical analysis (TMA) in Argon atmosphere. The XRD of the materials show the orthorhombic crystal symmetry with Pbnm space group. The SEM images of the pellets show that the samples sintered at 1200 °C are highly dense. The XRD after TGA in CO2and thermal expansion measurements confirm the stability. The particles of the samples are in micrometer ranges and increasing Zn content decreases the size. The conductivity measurements have been done in 5% H2with Ar in dry and wet atmospheres. All the materials show high proton conductivity in the intermediate temperature range (400–700 °C). The maximum proton conductivity was found to be 1.0 × 10−2S cm−1at 700 °C in wet atmosphere for x = 0.10. From our study, 10 wt % of Zn seems to be optimum at the B-site of the perovskite structure.
